1. Executive Summary
This comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report examines a dataset of LinkedIn 
posts from 69 influential professionals, comprising 34,012 individual posts. The analysis 
was conducted to support the development of TrendPilot, a system designed to help users 
create engaging LinkedIn posts optimized for maximum likes (reactions) and comments.
The primary objectives of this EDA were to: (1) identify data gaps and missing values that 
could impact model development, (2) assess the quality and reliability of the available data, 
(3) understand the distribution and relationships between key engagement metrics, and (4) 
evaluate how data limitations might affect the final project deliverables.
Key Findings at a Glance
Data Completeness: The dataset achieves 86.7% overall completeness and 95.4% 
completeness for core features essential to engagement prediction. This indicates the data 
is suitable for building machine learning models.
Critical Data Gap: Views data is 100% missing across all records. This is a significant 
limitation as it prevents optimization for post reach and virality metrics.
Engagement Metrics: Reactions and comments data is 100% complete, providing a solid 
foundation for building engagement prediction models. These metrics show a strong 
positive correlation (r=0.823).
Content Availability: 94.1% of posts have content text available, enabling robust natural 
language processing (NLP) analysis for content optimization features.
Media Impact: Video and image content significantly outperform articles in engagement 
metrics, with videos generating an average of 866 reactions compared to 161 for articles.
Temporal Limitation: Timestamps are stored in relative format ("1 day ago", "2 weeks 
ago") rather than absolute dates, preventing optimal posting time recommendations.

2. Introduction and Objectives
2.1 Background
LinkedIn has emerged as the premier professional networking platform, with over 900 
million users worldwide. For professionals, thought leaders, and businesses, creating 
engaging content on LinkedIn is crucial for building personal brands, establishing thought 
leadership, and driving business outcomes. However, the factors that contribute to high-
engagement posts are not always intuitive, and users often struggle to optimize their 
content for maximum impact.
This EDA supports the development of TrendPilot, an intelligent system designed to analyze 
patterns in successful LinkedIn posts and provide data-driven recommendations for 
content creation. By studying posts from verified influencers who consistently achieve high 
engagement, we can extract insights that will benefit everyday LinkedIn users.
2.2 Analysis Objectives
This exploratory data analysis was conducted with the following specific objectives:
1. Identify Data Gaps: Systematically catalog missing values, incomplete records, and 
data quality issues that could affect downstream analysis and model development.
2. Assess Data Quality: Evaluate the reliability, consistency, and accuracy of the collected 
data through statistical analysis and anomaly detection.
3. Understand Engagement Patterns: Analyze the distribution of engagement metrics 
(reactions, comments, views) and identify patterns associated with high-performing 
content.
4. Evaluate Feature Relationships: Examine correlations between content 
characteristics (length, hashtags, media type) and engagement outcomes.
5. Impact Assessment: Determine how identified data gaps and quality issues will affect 
the feasibility and scope of planned features in the final system.
2.3 Methodology
The analysis was conducted using Python with the following key libraries: Pandas for data 
manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for static 
visualizations, and Plotly for interactive dashboards. The analysis followed a structured 
approach:
● Data loading and initial inspection
● Missing value analysis and visualization
● Data type verification and conversion
● Statistical summary generation
● Distribution analysis with appropriate transformations
● Correlation analysis between features
● Segmented analysis by media type and influencer
● Risk assessment and impact evaluation

4. Data Gap Analysis - Missing Values
A thorough understanding of missing data is essential for any data science project. Missing 
values can introduce bias, reduce statistical power, and limit the features that can be 
implemented in the final system. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of missing 
data patterns in the LinkedIn influencer dataset.
4.1 Missing Values Summary
The following table presents a complete inventory of missing values across all 19 features in 
the dataset, sorted by the percentage of missing data from highest to lowest.

4.3 Interpretation of Missing Data Patterns
Critical Missing Data (>50%)
Two features have critically high levels of missing data that effectively render them 
unusable for analysis:
views (100% missing): The views column is entirely empty across all 34,012 records. This 
represents a significant data collection gap, as views/impressions are a key metric for 
understanding post reach and virality. Without this data, we cannot optimize content for 
maximum visibility or calculate view-to-engagement conversion rates. This gap likely 
resulted from LinkedIn API limitations or scraping restrictions that prevented access to 
view counts.
votes (99.75% missing): The votes column is nearly empty, with only 86 non-null values 
out of 34,012 records. However, this is expected behavior rather than a data quality issue - 
votes only apply to poll-type posts, which represent only 0.25% of the dataset. The 86 valid 
entries correspond exactly to the 86 poll posts in the data.
Moderate Missing Data (10-50%)
Two features fall into the moderate missing data category, requiring careful consideration 
for analysis:
connections (24.40% missing): Approximately one quarter of records lack connection 
count data. However, analysis of available data reveals that this field has limited analytical 
value - 99.7% of non-null values show "500+" (the LinkedIn display cap), while only 80 
records show the actual count of 171. This categorical nature limits its usefulness for 
quantitative analysis.
media_type (21.27% missing): About 21% of posts lack media type classification. This 
could indicate text-only posts without attachments, or could represent a data collection gap. 
Further investigation suggests these are likely text-only posts, as they still contain content 
but no media_url entries.
Minor Missing Data (<10%)
Several features have minor missing data that can be handled through standard imputation 
or exclusion techniques:
location (6.68% missing): Geographic location is missing for 2,272 records. This prevents 
geographic analysis for a subset of data but does not significantly impact content analysis 
features.
content (5.93% missing): Post content text is missing for 2,016 records. While this is a 
core feature, the 94% availability rate is sufficient for training NLP models. Missing content 
may indicate posts that were primarily media-based (images/videos) with minimal or no 
text.
followers (0.12% missing): Only 42 records lack follower count data, representing 
negligible missing data that can be easily imputed using the influencer's other posts.
5. Data Quality Assessment
Beyond missing values, data quality encompasses issues such as duplicate records, 
inconsistent formatting, outliers, and data type mismatches. This section examines these 
aspects to ensure the dataset is suitable for building reliable machine learning models.
5.1 Duplicate Records Analysis
Duplicate records can artificially inflate dataset size and skew analysis results. We 
examined the dataset for both exact duplicate rows and duplicate content.
Duplicate Type Count Percentage
Exact duplicate rows 0 0.00%
Duplicate content text 757 2.37%
The dataset contains no exact duplicate rows, indicating good data collection practices. 
However, 757 posts (2.37%) share identical content text. This could represent: (1) 
influencers reposting their own successful content, (2) common phrases or templates used 
across posts, or (3) cross-posted content. For model training, these duplicates should be 
considered - they may need to be deduplicated or weighted appropriately depending on the 
modeling approach.
5.2 Numerical Column Statistics
Understanding the statistical properties of numerical features is essential for feature 
engineering and model development. The table below presents comprehensive descriptive 
statistics for key numerical columns.
Statistic Followers Num 
Hashtags

Skewness High + High + High + High + High +
*Engagement Rate = Reactions per 1,000 followers
Key Observations from Statistics
Highly Skewed Distributions: All engagement metrics show extreme positive skewness, 
with means significantly higher than medians. For example, the mean reactions (473) is 
over 13 times the median (36). This indicates a small number of viral posts driving up 
averages, while most posts receive modest engagement.
Wide Range of Followers: Influencer follower counts span from 171 to over 18 million, 
representing a 100,000x range. This diversity is valuable for understanding how 
engagement scales with audience size.
Hashtag Usage Patterns: The median hashtag count is 0, meaning more than half of posts 
use no hashtags. The average of 2.1 hashtags is pulled up by a minority of posts with heavy 
hashtag usage (max 48).
Zero-Value Prevalence: A significant portion of posts have zero comments (32%) or zero 
reactions (3.1%), indicating that even influencer content doesn't always generate 
engagement.
5.3 Connections Field Analysis
The connections field exhibits unusual characteristics that warrant special attention. 
LinkedIn displays "500+" for users who have reached the connection limit, rather than 
showing the actual count.
Value Count Percentage
500+ 25,633 75.4%
171 80 0.2%
Missing 8,299 24.4%
This analysis reveals that the connections field has limited analytical utility. The 
overwhelming majority (99.7%) of non-null values are capped at "500+", making it 
essentially a binary indicator rather than a continuous variable. For modeling purposes, this 
field should either be: (1) converted to a binary feature (has_500_plus_connections), (2) 
excluded from analysis, or (3) treated as categorical.
5.4 Time Field Analysis
The time_spent field captures when posts were published, but in a relative format rather 
than absolute timestamps.
Time Value Count
1 year ago 7,753
2 years ago 5,728
3 years ago 3,759
4 years ago 2,126
3 months ago 1,456
2 months ago 1,448
4 months ago 1,279
10 months ago 1,247
11 months ago 1,133
Other values ~9,000
The relative time format presents a significant limitation for temporal analysis. Without 
absolute timestamps, we cannot: (1) determine optimal posting times (day of week, hour of 
day), (2) analyze engagement trends over time, (3) account for LinkedIn algorithm changes, 
or (4) perform time-series forecasting. The data does show that posts span approximately 
4+ years, providing good temporal diversity.
