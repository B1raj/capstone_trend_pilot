Base Score Calculation 
The algorithm prioritizes authentic storytelling with specific details over promotional 
content and heavily penalizes external links. 
Starting Point: 50 (average baseline) 
Factors That Adjust the Score 
1. Content Length (Word Count) 
• 100-200 words: +8 points (optimal) 
• 80-99 words: +5 points (good) 
• 200-300 words: +3 points (acceptable) 
• 50-79 words: -3 points (short) 
• <50 words: -12 points (too short) 
• >300 words: -15 points (too long) 
• >400 words: -15 points (way too long) 
2. Hook Patterns (First sentence analysis) 
Only the first matching hook counts: 
• "Never" narrative (overcoming doubt): +15 points 
• Specific time (e.g., "It's 2:47am"): +12 points

• Learning from adversity: +5 points 
• Value delivery promise: +4 points

7. Pattern Density (Total engagement elements) 
• 6+ patterns: +12 points (exceptional viral potential) 
• 4-5 patterns: +7 points (strong) 
• 3 patterns: +4 points (solid) 
• <2 patterns: -7 points (missing drivers) 
8. Low-Effort Link Post Penalty 
• <80 words + link + <2 patterns: -15 points (critical) 
9. Link Preview Spam

• Product-focused (score ≥4): -8 points  
o With video: additional -5 points 
• Some promotional (score ≥2): -4 points 
Final Score 
• Capped between 0-100 
• Score is: Math.min(Math.max(baseScore, 0), 100) 
Expected Metrics Calculation 
Once the final score is determined: 
Impression Multiplier 
Depends on whether content is promotional: 
Promotional Content (capped reach): 
• Score <40: 25-40% of followers 
• Score 40-55: 40-65% of followers 
• Score 55+: 65-100% of followers (max) 
Authentic Content (can go viral): 
• Score <40: 8-12% reach 
• Score 40-60: 12-30% reach 
• Score 60-70: 30-60% reach 
• Score 70-80: 60-120% reach 
• Score 80-90: 120-220% reach 
• Score 90+: 220-400%+ viral reach 
Engagement Breakdown 
• Base engagement rate: 1.5% 
• Adjusted rate: 1.5% + (score/100 × 2.5%) = max ~4% 
• Expected Impressions: Followers × Impression Multiplier 
• Total Engagements: Impressions × Engagement Rate 
• Reactions: 80% of total engagements 
• Comments: 20% of total engagements
