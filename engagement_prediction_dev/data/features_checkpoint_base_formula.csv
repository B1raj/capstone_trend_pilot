puneet-bhardwaj-849aa01,"AI at the speed of light! While researching the most recent advances in edge computing I came across a research paper published by MIT news last year in June. We talk a lot about ""The Edge,"" but the physical limits of silicon have always been the bottleneck. That changed in June of 2025. MIT News featured a breakthrough in photonic processing that could redefine 6G and beyond. Researchers have developed an optical AI chip—the MAFT-ONN—that processes signals at the speed of light. Its: - 100x faster than traditional digital chips. - Processes complex AI computations in nanoseconds. - Drastically more energy-efficient. Why does this matter for the future of AI Agents? Currently, high-level AI agents are ""cloud-bound"" because they need massive GPU power. This chip suggests a future where sophisticated, high-reasoning AI lives entirely on Edge Devices. Imagine drones & robotics with reaction times faster than biological entities. Imagine Privacy-Native AI that processes your most sensitive data locally, never hitting the cloud. Imagine ambient Intelligence where your wearables run complex LLMs in milli seconds, not minutes. We are moving from a world where we ""connect to AI"" to a world where AI is physically woven into the fabric of our environment—running on light, at the edge, in real-time. The bottleneck isn't the software anymore. It’s the physics of the hardware.

srinivasan-shan,"If you had told me in January that by December we’d be debating whether an AI agent should approve a $5,000 expense on its own… I’d have assumed you were joking. Yet here we are. AI slid into our workflows, sat down politely, and started doing real work, sometimes better than we expected, sometimes asking questions at the worst possible time, but always progressing. So grab a coffee (or a Negroni :P ). Here are the five moments that made 2025 unforgettable. 1. The Reasoning Leap: When AI Started Thinking Like Humans For years, AI’s personality trait was “answers instantly, confidence 100%.” Accuracy… varied. This year, models learned patience. OpenAI’s o3-pro and DeepSeek-R1 started taking the scenic route: breaking problems down checking constraints thinking before responding For product teams, it changed everything and delegating complex tasks felt reasonable. Satya Nadella captured this perfectly: This next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business. Although this new era promises great opportunity, it demands even greater responsibility from companies like our s. A small shift in behavior, a huge shift in trust. 2. Agentic AI: Your New Colleague 2025 is the year agents went from “cool demo” to “okay, this thing is running our workflows.” The simplest description of an AI agent? A colleague who takes initiative, asks fewer questions, and doesn’t ghost you before a deadline. You give it a goal, it figures out the steps and checks in only when it should. And yes, it works weekends. BCG says agents sped up processes by 30–50%. I’d argue they also reduced collective eye-rolls in project updates. For product leaders, this created a new design challenge: not what the user should do next… but what the agent should do next. A subtle but massive shift. 3. MCP: The App Store for AI If 2025 had an unsung hero, it was MCP. It quietly solved one of tech’s longest-running relationship issues: Getting systems to talk to each other without dragging engineering into yet another custom integration. Your AI assistant now plugs into databases, tools, and services the way we always wished software worked. The best part? Security teams like it, product teams love it and engineering no longer receives tickets titled “Quick integration?” (it never is). MCP didn’t make AI smarter, it rather made it useful . Why does this matter to you? Three reasons: Speed to deployment accelerates dramatically : Instead of 3-month integrations, new capabilities can be added in days. Risk decreases : Standardized connections mean security teams can audit once and trust multiple integrations, rather than individually vetting custom code. Everyone becomes a power user : Non-technical product managers can configure AI agents to access new data sources without relying on engineering backlogs. Anthropic's Claude, running in Claude Desktop or integrated into AI-enhanced IDEs like Cursor, can now work with real-time data sources as easily as it processes text in a conversation. 4. Video Coding Got Smarter than Ever 2025 also delivered one of my favourite quietly brilliant upgrades. AI now decides, frame-by-frame, how much quality your video actually needs. Big action scene? Max quality. A quiet hallway shot? Chill, lower bitrate. Netflix cuts bandwidth by 50% , YouTube by 30% , all thanks to AI choosing smarter compression. For teams, that means: Lower costs Better user experience Smaller carbon footprint This is powered by content-aware encoding: AI analyzing each scene and allocating compute only where it matters. Even heavy codecs like AV1 now encode 40% faster with ML-tuned pipelines. And the best part: this idea won’t stay in video. Anywhere compute can be smarter, AI is stepping in. 5. Innovation Became Borderless The DeepSeek-R1 launch was a plot twist none of us expected. It didn’t just demonstrate capability, it signaled a geographical shift. 2025 proved that frontier models, ecosystem breakthroughs, and serious AI innovation can come from anywhere: Asia-Pacific, LATAM, the Middle East, Africa. For teams building global products, it’s a simple takeaway: Talent is now a global resource. Your next great contributor may not be in your timezone and that’s a good thing. Where AI Became Non-Negotiable AI stopped “experimenting” this year and started earning its keep across industries: Healthcare: Earlier cancer detection, MRI reads in minutes not hours, and personalized treatment becoming standard. A $600B market suddenly feels… justified. Finance: Fraud models now catch anomalies before humans even feel suspicious. Credit decisions that took weeks? Hours. Portfolios? AI basically became everyone’s quiet co-manager. Manufacturing: Supply chains got their own early-warning system. AI spotted cost spikes, flagged risks, and kept factories a step ahead instead of a step behind. Pharma: Discovery timelines collapsed from years to months, as AI models ran molecular simulations at speeds humans can’t even pretend to match. Across the board, AI didn’t disrupt these industries, it became the part they can’t imagine working without. The Year Everyone Started Asking, “But does it actually work?” My favourite cultural shift of 2025: Teams finally demanded measurement. Not dashboards for vanity. But real, controlled comparisons that answered: Is this faster? Is this better? Is this trustworthy? McKinsey's research shows that while 58% of organizations report productivity gains from generative AI, most lack rigorous measurement frameworks. This discipline forced clearer thinking, better products, and fewer surprises in production. Why 2025 Mattered to Your Role 2025 quietly updated everyone’s job description. If you build tech: You’ve moved from training models in isolation to wiring them into real ecosystems. The core skill now is orchestration , not just optimization. If you build products: Your toolkit expands too. You’re designing guardrails for autonomous agents, understanding where reasoning models shine, proving ROI with real measurement, and balancing speed with governance without slowing teams down. And the bigger shift? AI stopped being a vertical. It became infrastructure. We’re no longer asking Should we use AI? We’re asking How deeply and how responsibly do we integrate it? Sundar Pichai captured the moment perfectly: “AI is probably the most important thing humanity has ever worked on… Imagine a world where it can diagnose diseases earlier, personalize education, and create a more sustainable future.” 2025 proved that vision isn’t theoretical anymore, it’s running in production, quietly shaping how we build and operate.

ai stopped being a vertical. it became infrastructure. were no longer asking should we use ai? were asking how deeply and how responsibly do we integrate it? sundar pichai captured the moment perfectly: ai is probably the most important thing humanity has ever worked on imagine a world where it can diagnose diseases earlier, personalize education, and create a more sustainable future. 2025 proved that vision isnt theoretical anymore, its running in production, quietly shaping how we build and operate. as we head into 2026, im curious: what shifted for you this year?",-15,too_long,"if you had told me in january that by december wed be debating whether an ai agent should approve a 5,000 expense on its own id have assumed you were joking",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,5,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,3,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,63,63

srinivasan-shan,"APIs were supposed to make systems talk. Then we taught the systems to think. And suddenly, that clean highway of REST calls turned into an orchestra of reasoning. Now every enterprise stack hums with agents, context windows, and prompts whispering across clouds. Data moves and intent moves faster. And somewhere between those two, chaos sneaks in quietly. The Old Playbook Is Broken The traditional infrastructure story of API gateways, firewalls, rate limits was written for deterministic systems. They handled packets, not probabilities. The numbers tell a stark story. According to recent enterprise data, 99% of organizations surveyed reported financial losses from AI-related risks , with nearly two-thirds suffering losses exceeding $1 million. The average ~ $4.4 million per company . The culprits: non-compliance with regulations (57%), biased outputs (53%), and negative impacts to sustainability (55%). The Illusion of Control: What AI Gateways Actually Are Some are calling it the air traffic control for AI calls. But that metaphor understates what's happening. An AI Gateway is a specialized policy enforcement layer that sits between applications and LLM services. Unlike traditional API gateways that manage requests, AI gateways understand intention . What They Actually Do: Scrub prompts before they leave your network - Detecting and redacting PII (names, credit card numbers, SSNs) using pattern matching and ML-based scanners Track which model or agent did what - Creating immutable audit logs for every token, every decision path, every model interaction Cache reasoning to avoid deja vu at scale - Semantic caching can reduce token costs by 70%, with organizations reporting 42-98% reductions in token spend by implementing gateway-level optimization Watch token flow the way firewalls watched bytes - Real-time cost monitoring and budget enforcement prevent runaway spend Enforce compliance before chaos gets creative - Preventing prompt injections, blocking unauthorized data access, validating outputs for hallucinations In short, it's not about more APIs. It's about more awareness between them. The Cost Case: Why This Matters Financially Enterprises aren't adopting AI gateways for philosophical reasons. Consider the economics: A telecom company routing all requests through GPT-4 was spending $200k/month . After deploying an AI gateway with dynamic model routing (funneling 60% of tasks to cheaper models), they achieved a 42% cost reduction that's $84k back per month . More than a million dollars annually. Semantic caching alone creates outsized returns. A banking firm handling high-volume customer support saw customers ask identical questions repeatedly. By caching common interactions (""Hi"" & ""Hello, how can I help?""), they reduced annual token costs from $92,500 to $2,500 ~ 97% savings on repetitive exchanges. Adding a gateway introduces latency. It adds weight. You're inserting observation between every request and response, and observation costs CPU cycles. The trade-off: You lose milliseconds. You gain visibility, cost control, and compliance certainty. The Governance Reality Check Here's what keeps CISOs awake: According to recent governance surveys, only 12% of C-suite respondents could correctly identify appropriate controls for five common AI risks. Chief Risk Officers? 11% . Slightly worse. This governance gap is a feature, not a bug, of autonomous systems. Traditional AI governance frameworks were built for prediction engines ”models that output scores or classifications. You could audit model behavior, check for bias, and call it done. Agentic AI flips the script. Agents don't just predict; they act . They delete files, modify databases, and make decisions with irreversible consequences. The risks compounds are Unbounded Autonomy: Without clearly codified limits, agents may exceed their intended scope. A logistics agent optimizing shipments might inadvertently breach service-level agreements or disrupt inventory priorities. Opaque Decision Flows: When agents self-adapt or collaborate, their decision logic becomes difficult to trace. During an audit, you can't easily reconstruct why a specific action occurred. Runtime Drift: Over time, agents diverge from initial parameters as they learn from evolving data. A recommendation agent might shift from long-term customer value to short-term engagement if reward signals drift subtly. The EU AI Act is in action from August 2025, the European AI Office will enforce mandatory documentation, conformity assessments, and incident reporting (within 15 days of detection). Organizations deploying high-risk AI without governance infrastructure will face fines up to 4% of global revenue for non-compliance. The Observability Imperative 70% of organizations are implementing observability frameworks to meet regulatory requirements. Why? Because the question that haunts board rooms is simple: What did the AI just do, and why did it do it? OpenTelemetry is becoming the industry standard. Organizations integrating OpenTelemetry reported a 50% reduction in compatibility issues when introducing new monitoring tools. Automated prompt testing in CI/CD pipelines? 60% faster issue resolution and 70% confidence boost in model updates. The cost of not observing is brutal. LLM hallucinations in production are expensive: Each hallucination caught after user exposure damages trust and brand Monitoring hallucination rates requires running LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators (which double your token costs) But the alternative ”deploying hallucinating models to production” is worse One financial services firm implementing comprehensive LLM observability discovered their assistant was confidently providing false information to 8% of queries. Without observability infrastructure, those errors would have compounded silently, customer by customer. The Control-Curiosity Tension Now we arrive at the real question your organization faces: Do we govern intelligence, or do we let it run wild and learn? Some teams are wiring AI gateways already. Others see it as overkill ""another box in the stack"" And maybe both are right. Because building control planes for systems that think feels paradoxical. How much do you govern something designed to improvise? How many constraints can you add before you've caged the thing you built to be free? The middle ground is emerging - AI gateways aren't about stopping agents. They're about observing them in real-time and intervening only when necessary . The Short-Term vs. Long-Term Play Maybe AI gateways are a short-term seatbelt ”a comfort layer before enterprises trust the autopilot entirely. They become standard issue as AI matures or maybe they're the new backbone of enterprise AI architecture ”the layer that separates responsible deployment from chaos. Too early to call. What's clear: The next generation of infrastructure isn't about uptime or throughput. It's about understanding what the system just decided and why .Regulatory bodies are betting on it. CISOs are provisioning for it. And enterprises that move fast on observability and governance today will be the ones explaining their decisions confidently tomorrow, not scrambling through audits and incident responses. The Real Question for Your Stack We once built gateways for APIs. Now we're quietly designing them for our minds. Ask yourself: Where are my AI requests flowing? Track the paths across providers, models, and agents to avoid black-box routing and optimize performance. Can I trace every decision? Dive into token-by-token, prompt-by-prompt, and model-by-model logs for full transparency in AI reasoning. Do I know what data left my network? Monitor outbound data flows and formats to safeguard sensitive information in real-time. Can I prove compliance if regulators ask? Maintain robust audit trails, consent records, and decision logs to demonstrate adherence to standards like DORA or OWASP Control doesn't constrain innovation. Visibility does. The teams winning in 2025 aren't the ones that locked down AI. They're the ones that understood it.

oliver-reeves,"2020 was a weird roller-coaster ride and a half, and has not exactly been kind to us all - both in a personal and professional way. As an owner of a business and CEO, 2020 was a very hard pill to swallow. When the COVD-19 pandemic hit the UK, we lost a good chunk of our clients as well as active jobs. Our specialised markets in Singapore and the US were hit hard, but thankfully it was not as bad as I thought it would be (in hindsight). Organisations immediately froze their hiring cycles due to the cash flow crunch, causing some major problems for candidates who had already handed in their notices and were ready to start their new roles when their positions were pulled. Many of our good friends were left in the lurch, not knowing what to do or expect while in limbo. Job openings were scarce and companies’ cash flow were tight (if not non-existent), resulting in more developers than there were jobs. Fortunately, some found temporary placements as we all rode the relentless waves of COVID, though not many were that lucky. As an experienced headhunter in the recruitment business, nothing pains me more than not being able to help others land the jobs they are deserving of. From a business perspective, 2020 was a rough ride for us. Fortunately, we were able to build a steady stream of clients, predominantly in the Health-Tech and Ed-Tech sectors. Two industries that were forced to scale up their digital presence due to the pandemic. Thankfully, we were still able to place developers and maintain our finances to keep our heads above water. When COVID-19 was rearing its ugly head in full force here in the UK, I kept reassuring myself and my team that “it would be over in three months” and it “won’t be long until this blows over”. Boy was I so wrong about that. Looking back, it could have gone badly wrong if I wasn’t careful about my words - I could have unintentionally demotivated the entire team when I was actually meaning good. When you’re managing a team and you sincerely want the best for them, it’s pretty much a sucker-punch to the guts when there are forces that are way out of your control blocking their success. Furthermore from a financial stance, I could have furloughed (In the UK, you can temporarily put staff on ‘paid leave’ for six months, and the government can help pay for 80% of their salary if there is no work available) the team in order to save costs. However as two of my staff have young children, I knew they wouldn’t be able to survive on the furlough payments alone. Hence, I decided to face the problem head on. Like Icarus flew too closely to the sun, we did feel a bit of a pinch. But as 2021 began, we’ve taken off on a strong foot and are flying once again. As they say: New Year, New Beginnings. It looks like many organisations are making up for lost time and are starting to aggressively hire. Thus, developers now have the chance to look for new placements and get a new lease on their careers. On reflection, 2020 hasn’t been a smooth wave to ride (surfer pun intended), but I can’t help but notice that the recruitment industry has had to adapt to the unexpected changes in order to survive. As we move into an era where what we knew as ‘normal’ isn’t ‘normal’ anymore, the recruitment industry must be better prepared for similar curveballs in the future.

ceposta,"In the previous blog , we dug into dynamically registering OAuth clients leveraging SPIFFE and SPIRE. We used SPIRE to issue software statements in the SPIFFE JWT SVID that Keycloak can trust as part of Dynamic Client Registration ( RFC 7591 ). Once we have an OAuth client, we will want to continue to use SPIFFE to authenticate to our Authorization Server. This eliminates the need for a long-lived “client secret” which is common for Confidential OAuth . This means we can use the Agent or MCP client’s SPIFFE identity for authorization flows. We dig into that topic in this blog. TL;DR If you want to see a quick demo of this working: OAuth Client Authentication OAuth 2.0 (and extensions like RFC 7523) specify a few ways an OAuth client can authenticate itself to the Authorization Server (AS): client_secret_basic - HTTP Basic (default) client_secret_post - Form POST private_key_jwt - JWT with private key client_secret_jwt - JWT with shared secret (less common) none - Public client (no authentication) tls_client_auth - Mutual TLS self_signed_tls_client_auth - Self-signed mutual TLS A very common approach in microservice and machine-to-machine environments is to use a confidential client and “client credentials” flow. When the OAuth client is registered, it is issued a client_id and client_secret. This id/secret is presented to authenticate the client to the AS. The big problem with this approach is that these are usually long-lived secrets (rarely rotated) and must be kept safe somehow. Confidential clients are assumed to have some safe storage, but even so, this is an additional burden on the client to not slip up (logs, configs, copy/paste) and reveal these secrets. Lastly, these secrets are “pre-shared secrets” and not rooted in cryptography. In a scenario where SPIFFE is used to issue cryptographically verifiable workload identity / agent identity / MCP client identity, we can use SPIFFE SVIDs for authenticating to the AS. That is, instead of passing static secrets, we can pass a short lived SPIFFE JWT SVIDs (or client certificates) to authenticate. An Internet Draft at the IETF has been started by Pieter Kasselman et. al. which describes this scenario . I’ve recently implemented this draft spec in some working examples I’ve been exploring and would like to share how it all works. SPIFFE SVID Client Authentication One question I had when digging into this is: can’t we just use private_key_jwt ( RFC 7523 ) to do this? That is, just give the AS the public keys for the SPIFFE/SPIRE implementation, and let the IdP/AS trust JWTs that are issued from that system? The original intent behind private_key_jwt is for the OAuth client to have a private key that can be used to identify itself while the AS has the public key. So the client can create a JWT, sign it, and send it for authentication. The AS can prove that the JWT was created by the OAuth client and use that for authentication. In this scenario, Authorization Servers may expect the iss and sub claims to be the same since this is a private-key scenario where the issuer should be the subject . In the SPIFFE scenario, this is not the case. Additionally, good implementations should also try to prevent replay attacks by tracking jti. For example, Keycloak does both of these things (checks iss==sub and tracks jti) for its implementation of RFC 7523. Another alternative can be identity brokering. For example, Keycloak allows setting up identity federation/brokering . The problem is, Keycloak expects a full implementation of a token provider. Using SPIRE as our SPIFFE implementation, SPIRE does not support full OAuth/OIDC token endpoints. Since we cannot use private_key_jwt or identity brokering (in Keycloak), what options do we have? One option is to extend Keycloak to support a new client authentication mechanism. Extending Keycloak for SPIFFE client authentication To get this POC to work, we need to extend Keycloak. You can follow along in this GitHub repo to see the code . Keycloak is written in Java and has a nice “Service Provider Interface” (SPI) model for extending many parts of Keycloak, including client authentication. To extend Keycloak to support a SPIFFE JWT authentication mechanism, we need to implement the ClientAuthenticatorFactory class. I do this in the SpiffeSvidClientAuthenticator class: public class SpiffeSvidClientAuthenticator extends AbstractClientAuthenticator { public static final String PROVIDER_ID = ""client-spiffe-jwt""; @Override public void authenticateClient(ClientAuthenticationFlowContext context) { SpiffeSvidClientValidator validator = new SpiffeSvidClientValidator(context, getId()); validator.readJws(); // ...more impl here... validator.validateToken(); context.success(); } @Override public Set<String> getProtocolAuthenticatorMethods(String loginProtocol) { if (loginProtocol.equals(OIDCLoginProtocol.LOGIN_PROTOCOL)) { Set<String> results = new HashSet<>(); results.add(""spiffe_svid_jwt""); return results; } } } A couple things to notice here. We specify a PROVIDER_ID of client-spiffe-jwt which can be used under the covers in Keycloak to refer to this new authentication mechanism. We also implement an “authenticator method” spiffe_svid_jwt which can be used by OAuth clients in authorization flows to identify which authentication method to use (ie, urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:spiffe-svid-jwt ). Not shown above, but you can check the code , we can also extend the configuration that you see in the UI to specify additional properties that can be used in the custom client authenticator. For example, I added an issuer property that can be configured and used in the custom client authentication validation. From here, we need to load this into a stock Keycloak (we use a recent version at the time of writing). Here’s an example using Docker Compose: services: keycloak-idp: image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:26.2.5 environment: KC_HEALTH_ENABLED: ""true"" KEYCLOAK_ADMIN: admin KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD: admin ports: - ""8080:8080"" volumes: - ./spiffe-svid-client-authenticator-1.0.0.jar:/opt/keycloak/providers/spiffe-svid-client-authenticator-1.0.0.jar:ro command: start-dev networks: - keycloak-shared-network When we start Keycloak, we should see that our SPI gets loaded: keycloak-idp-1 | 2025-07-29 02:03:09,255 WARN [org.keycloak.services] (build-38) KC-SERVICES0047: client-spiffe-jwt (com.yourcompany.keycloak.authenticator.SpiffeSvidClientAuthenticator) is implementing the internal SPI client-authenticator. This SPI is internal and may change without notice If we go to an existing OAuth client (or create a new one), and navigate to the Credentials tab, we should see the new SPIFFE SVID JWT authenticator type. If we select the SPIFFE SVID JWT authenticator, we can see our custom configuration fields (just one in this case, issuer ): We will configure the issuer with the SPIRE server address. We will also need to configure the JWKS that Keycloak should trust, but SPIRE doesn’t support this out of the box . Luckily, they have a pre-built addon to support OIDC style discovery. SPIRE OIDC Discovery Endpoint SPIRE is a workload attestation engine and implements the SPIFFE spec. It can issue x509 or JWT SVIDs. For JWTs, it does not expose its public key/JWKS out of the box. Luckily, a simple JWKS discovery endpoint is available to support an OAuth federation / brokering scenario. We need to stand this up and configure it to work with our SPIRE server. Here’s an example using Docker Compose: spire-oidc-discovery: image: ghcr.io/spiffe/oidc-discovery-provider:1.12.4 container_name: spire-oidc-discovery depends_on: - spire-server ports: - ""18443:8443"" volumes: - ./oidc-discovery-provider.conf:/opt/spire/conf/oidc-discovery-provider.conf:ro - spire-server-socket:/tmp/spire-server/private:ro working_dir: /opt/spire/conf command: [""-config"", ""oidc-discovery-provider.conf""] networks: - keycloak_keycloak-shared-network Note, the SPIRE OIDC discovery endpoint needs its own configuration and access to the SPIRE server. Ideally this endpoint is co-located with the SPIRE server and can access the SPIRE server’s Unix Domain Socket (UDS). Here’s our configuration for the OIDC discovery endpoint (note, for demo purposes, I’m using an insecure/http endpoint): log_level = ""INFO"" domains = [""spire-server"", ""spire-oidc-discovery"", ""localhost""] # Use HTTP for local development (no certificates needed) insecure_addr = "":8443"" allow_insecure_scheme = true server_api { address = ""unix:///tmp/spire-server/private/api.sock"" } health_checks {} Lastly, we’ll need to tune some parameters on the server.conf for the SPIRE server itself: server { ... # Add JWT issuer for OIDC (using HTTP for local development) jwt_issuer = ""http://spire-server:8443"" default_jwt_svid_ttl = ""1m"" # Configure RSA key type (required for OIDC) ca_key_type = ""rsa-2048"" # Add federation bundle endpoint federation { bundle_endpoint { address = ""0.0.0.0"" port = 8443 } } } If we curl this discovery endpoint, we can see the discovery metadata and keys: ❯ curl -L http://localhost:18443/.well-known/openid-configuration { ""issuer"": ""http://localhost:18443"", ""jwks_uri"": ""http://localhost:18443/keys"", ""authorization_endpoint"": """", ""response_types_supported"": [ ""id_token"" ], ""subject_types_supported"": [ ""public"" ], ""id_token_signing_alg_values_supported"": [ ""RS256"", ""ES256"", ""ES384"" ] } JWKS endpoint: ❯ curl -L http://localhost:18443/keys { ""keys"": [ { ""kty"": ""RSA"", ""kid"": ""n0xvkL8A2W3DofkHTJPvlGpeEBJeQB6g"", ""alg"": ""RS256"", ""n"": ""sAp_Vd-X-W7OllYPm_TTk0zvUj443Y9MfQvy4onBcursyxOajcoeSOeNpTdh4QEmLKV3xC8Zq Yv4fkzFp6UTf-_rwPs_uwOpbhPKT-QQZKcconxaf8RkA0m-mzOVHbU7eA3esHLTzN84kbGkr1wozQes yC-MHFE3EwLR9xI1YZfWbHtlXOcnTgBXitgysM5Yw4jkXy7kYvjs21MyEJ01_WSSHCLaISAjlAvnDL WiGV3xx0Vd29m8-mrR5pg4_eicBifxnQnksO_LWRy8jXKk2JTftRKnmIxwqHML_fbVej8RSsaGpu0askj 83gZ4wNDi8KNh7c9ir6yWl9jgDJ3lYQ"", ""e"": ""AQAB"" } ] } See the SPIRE OIDC Discovery Provider for more. With this setup, we can now configure the Keycloak JWKS endpoint to point to the SPIRE OIDC Discovery endpoint: OAuth Client Authentication with SPIFFE in Action With Keycloak configured to use our SPIFFE SVID JWT authenticator, and correctly pointing to the SPIRE JWKS, we can now get a workload SVID and make a call to Keycloak for an authorization flow / client credentials flow to get an access token. To get a SPIFFE JWT SVID, we can call the spire-agent workload API. Here’s an example SPIFFE JWT SVID: { ""aud"": [ ""http://localhost:8080/realms/mcp-realm"" ], ""client_auth"": ""client-spiffe-jwt"", ""environment"": ""production"", ""exp"": 1753800643, ""iat"": 1753800583, ""iss"": ""http://spire-server:8443"", ""jwks_url"": ""http://spire-oidc-discovery:8443/keys"", ""organization"": ""Solo.io Agent IAM"", ""scope"": ""mcp:read mcp:tools mcp:prompts"", ""sub"": ""spiffe://example.org/mcp-test-client"" } This JWT is signed by spiffe with the correct SPIFFE ID (spiffe://example.org/mcp-test-client). It has a tight expiration period, and it has additional software statements. Note the client_auth software statement / claim here points to client-spiffe-jwt which was the PROVIDER_ID we specified in our SpiffeSvidClientAuthenticator class. With this SPIFFE JWT SVID, we can call the token endpoint with the spiffe-svid-jwt and $JWT client assertions. In this particular example, we are using a client_credentials flow: curl -s -X POST \ ""$KEYCLOAK_URL/realms/$KEYCLOAK_REALM/protocol/openid-connect/token"" \ -H ""Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" \ -d ""client_id=$CLIENT_ID"" \ -d ""grant_type=client_credentials"" \ -d ""client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:spiffe-svid-jwt"" \ -d ""client_assertion=$JWT"" \ -d ""scope=mcp:read mcp:tools mcp:prompts"" If this is successful, Keycloak will issue an access token: { ""exp"": 1753804189, ""iat"": 1753800589, ""jti"": ""trrtcc:35d1fb20-31fa-4055-afb8-e902d0dc25d4"", ""iss"": ""http://localhost:8080/realms/mcp-realm"", ""sub"": ""6e4b5bc5-9a5c-4f87-aa1e-06ad279da0c8"", ""typ"": ""Bearer"", ""azp"": ""spiffe://example.org/mcp-test-client"", ""acr"": ""1"", ""scope"": ""profile email"", ""email_verified"": false, ""clientHost"": ""192.168.65.1"", ""preferred_username"": ""service-account-spiffe://example.org/mcp-test-client"", ""clientAddress"": ""192.168.65.1"", ""client_id"": ""spiffe://example.org/mcp-test-client"" } Wrapping Up In this post, we explored how Agent / MCP identity based on SPIFFE can be used as a first-class authentication mechanism for OAuth clients. By integrating SPIFFE JWT SVIDs with Keycloak’s client authentication flow, we eliminated the need for static secrets and created a more secure, scalable model for authenticating MCP clients especially in environments where agents and services need short-lived, verifiable credentials. While this approach required some customization in Keycloak (through its SPI model) and configuration of the SPIRE OIDC Discovery endpoint, the end result is a working OAuth flow powered by cryptographically-verifiable, zero-trust-friendly identity. This isn’t just a more secure option, it’s a necessary evolution as we shift toward AI-native, agentic architectures that demand dynamic trust relationships and automated credential management.",147.0,19.0,198,,12127,article,0,9,1,"['http://spire-server:8443', 'http://localhost:18443/.well-known/openid-configuration', 'http://localhost:18443', 'http://localhost:18443/keys',

authentication. in this scenario, authorization servers may expect the iss and sub claims to be the same since this is a private-key scenario where the issuer should be the subject . in the spiffe scenario, this is not the case. additionally, good implementations should also try to prevent replay attacks by tracking jti. for example, keycloak does both of these things checks isssub and tracks jti for its implementation of rfc 7523. another alternative can be identity brokering. for example, keycloak allows setting up identity federationbrokering . the problem is, keycloak expects a full implementation of a token provider. using spire as our spiffe implementation, spire does not support full oauthoidc token endpoints. since we cannot use privatekeyjwt or identity brokering in keycloak, what options do we have? one option is to extend keycloak to support a new client authentication mechanism. extending keycloak for spiffe client authentication to get this poc to work, we need to extend keycloak. you can follow along in this github repo to see the code . keycloak is written in java and has a nice service provider interface spi model for extending many parts of keycloak, including client authentication. to extend keycloak to support a spiffe jwt authentication mechanism, we need to implement the clientauthenticatorfactory class. i do this in the spiffesvidclientauthenticator class: public class spiffesvidclientauthenticator extends abstractclientauthenticator  public static final string providerid  ""client-spiffe-jwt""; mentionclientauthenticationflowcontext context  spiffesvidclientvalidator validator  new spiffesvidclientvalidatorcontext, getid; validator.readjws;  ...more impl here... validator.validatetoken; context.success;  mentionstring getprotocolauthenticatormethodsstring loginprotocol  if loginprotocol.equalsoidcloginprotocol.loginprotocol  setstring results  new hashset; results.add""spiffesvidjwt""; return results;    a couple things to notice here. we specify a providerid of client-spiffe-jwt which can be used under the covers in keycloak to refer to this new authentication mechanism. we also implement an authenticator method spiffesvidjwt which can be used by oauth clients in authorization flows to identify which authentication method to use ie, urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:spiffe-svid-jwt . not shown above, but you can check the code , we can also extend the configuration that you see in the ui to specify additional properties that can be used in the custom client authenticator. for example, i added an issuer property that can be configured and used in the custom client authentication validation. from here, we need to load this into a stock keycloak we use a recent version at the time of writing. heres an example using docker compose: services: keycloak-idp: image: quay.iokeycloakkeycloak:26.2.5 environment: kchealthenabled: ""true"" keycloakadmin: admin keycloakadminpassword: admin ports: - ""8080:8080"" volumes: -

see that our spi gets loaded: keycloak-idp-1  2025-07-29 02:03:09,255 warn org.keycloak.services build-38 kc-services0047: client-spiffe-jwt com.yourcompany.keycloak.authenticator.spiffesvidclientauthenticator is implementing the internal spi client-authenticator. this spi is internal and may change without notice if we go to an existing oauth client or create a new one, and navigate to the credentials tab, we should see the new spiffe svid jwt authenticator type. if we select the spiffe svid jwt authenticator, we can see our custom configuration fields just one in this case, issuer : we will configure the issuer with the spire server address. we will also need to configure the jwks that keycloak should trust, but spire doesnt support this out of the box . luckily, they have a pre-built addon to support oidc style discovery. spire oidc discovery endpoint spire is a workload attestation engine and implements the spiffe spec. it can issue x509 or jwt svids. for jwts, it does not expose its public keyjwks out of the box. luckily, a simple jwks discovery endpoint is available to support an oauth federation  brokering scenario. we need to stand this up and configure it to work with our spire server. heres an example using docker compose: spire-oidc-discovery: image: ghcr.iospiffeoidc-discovery-provider:1.12.4 containername: spire-oidc-discovery dependson: - spire-server ports: - ""18443:8443"" volumes: - .oidc-discovery-provider.conf:optspireconfoidc-discovery-provider.conf:ro -

endpoint needs its own configuration and access to the spire server. ideally this endpoint is co-located with the spire server and can access the spire servers unix domain socket uds. heres our configuration for the oidc discovery endpoint note, for demo purposes, im using an insecurehttp endpoint: loglevel  ""info"" domains  ""spire-server"", ""spire-oidc-discovery"", ""localhost"" # use http for local development no certificates needed insecureaddr  "":8443"" allowinsecurescheme  true serverapi  address  ""unix:tmpspire-serverprivateapi.sock""  healthchecks  lastly, well need to tune

with spiffe in action with keycloak configured to use our spiffe svid jwt authenticator, and correctly pointing to the spire jwks, we can now get a workload svid and make a call to keycloak for an authorization flow  client credentials flow to get an access token. to get a spiffe jwt svid, we can call the spire-agent workload api. heres an example spiffe jwt svid:  ""aud"":  ""url"" , ""clientauth"": ""client-spiffe-jwt"", ""environment"": ""production"", ""exp"": 1753800643, ""iat"": 1753800583, ""iss"": ""url"", ""jwksurl"": ""url"", ""organization"": ""solo.io agent iam"", ""scope"": ""mcp:read mcp:tools mcp:prompts"", ""sub"": ""spiffe:example.orgmcp-test-client""  this jwt is signed by spiffe with the correct spiffe id spiffe:example.orgmcp-test-client. it has a tight expiration period, and it has additional software statements. note the clientauth software statement  claim here points to client-spiffe-jwt which was the providerid we specified in our spiffesvidclientauthenticator class. with this spiffe jwt svid, we can call the token endpoint with the spiffe-svid-jwt and jwt client assertions. in this particular example, we are using a clientcredentials flow: curl -s -x post  ""keycloakurlrealmskeycloakrealmprotocolopenid-connecttoken""  -h ""content-type: applicationx-www-form-urlencoded""  -d ""clientidclientid""  -d

this post, we explored how agent  mcp identity based on spiffe can be used as a first-class authentication mechanism for oauth clients. by integrating spiffe jwt svids with keycloaks client authentication flow, we eliminated the need for static secrets and created a more secure, scalable model for authenticating mcp clients especially in environments where agents and services need short-lived, verifiable credentials. while this approach required some customization in keycloak through its spi model and configuration of the spire oidc discovery endpoint, the end result is a working oauth flow powered by cryptographically-verifiable, zero-trust-friendly identity. this isnt just a more secure option, its a necessary evolution as we shift toward ai-native, agentic

oliver-reeves,"Ever since venturing out and starting my own boutique headhunting agency, my mission was to always give back to the community and create the best candidate experience I could. Part of that experience includes preparing candidates for their interviews and guiding them through the process; providing them with encouragement and feedback along the way. Here are just some of what I think is most important for candidates to keep in mind as they prepare for interviews. Before attending your interview, make sure to do your homework! Research the company you will be interviewing with - familiarise yourself with their company mission, vision and what their goals are. More often than not, the interviewer will spring the “So, tell me about my company” question on you. By reading ahead and doing your research about the company, you are indirectly showing the interviewer your confidence, your investment in learning more and how you might be able to contribute to the company mission. The more engaged you are with the interviewer and the company, the better you fare. Nothing turns people away more than coming across disinterested and ingenuine. Furthermore, doing prior research about the company opens up the opportunity for you to ask the interviewer questions. As the saying goes, “If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail”. As you are speaking to the interviewer, be sure to have a notepad and pen with you to scribble down some notes and potential questions you might have. Not only does this show you are attentive and actively listening to the interviewer, this also allows you to ask the interviewer good questions about the company - anything from work culture to the company’s management style. The aim here is to make the interviewer go “Oh, that is an excellent question!”. As an employer myself, I feel impressed when a candidate can make me pause to think about an answer to a question. It shows me that they are thoughtful and have a lot of ideas to contribute to the organisation. Additionally, asking the interviewer questions opens the door to building a rapport with them. As humans, we are social creatures and we all value quality relationships. Building a connection with the interviewer can make your candidacy stand out even more. Passion and enthusiasm. Two qualities that I think are incredibly important in candidates (and humans in general). Do not be afraid to be a bit more forward and show your eagerness about your profession as well as the job. Show that you are keen to learn, and are passionate about widening your knowledge base. Nothing is more attractive than demonstrating your passion for the job you are applying for. It shows tenacity - something that I think many candidates lack. Last but not least, do not ever give up after unsuccessful interviews. Just to be clear, candidates are more likely to encounter more unsuccessful interviews than successful ones. It is all part of the process and trust me when I say that it is worth it in the end. Not only do you get plenty of opportunities to pick up tips and tricks to improve your interview game, you get plenty of practice to build up your confidence too! Over the years, my experience has led me to observe what makes a difference between a good candidate, and an outstanding one. With practice, preparation and time, you will be able to see a difference in your confidence and performance from one interview to another.

ceposta,"As I work with enterprise users adopting AI agents, questions around authorization, impersonation, and delegation come up again and again. OAuth is already a delegation protocol, so where does it fall short for agentic systems? How do familiar flows like Authorization Code or Microsoft’s long-standing “On Behalf Of” model apply when the caller is no longer just a user or an app but an AI agent making decisions on its own? Who is actually acting? Who is accountable? This post unpacks where traditional OAuth fits, where it breaks down, and what changes when agents enter the picture. OAuth Delegation OAuth is fundamentally an authorization delegation protocol. What is being delegated? A user delegates limited access of their data to an specific application . In OAuth terms, the user is the resource owner, the application is the client, and the backend API is the resource server. For example, let’s say a User (ceposta) has some data exposed on a Backend API (backend_api). Maybe it’s a system that knows about my laptop ordering history. Someone else (third-party?) built an application (supply_chain_app) that helps me optimize my laptop ordering and I really want to use it but it needs access to my ordering history (backend_api). When I login to the Application, it can walk me through the OAuth Authorization code dance to consent “delegating read-only access” to the Backend API for my data. Now, if I consent, the Application will get a limited-scope access_token it can use to call the Backend API to read data about my ordering history. From the perspective of the Backend API, this delegated call is indistinguishable from the user calling the API directly. The sub represents the user, and the application’s involvement is largely invisible at authorization time. This ambiguity is usually acceptable when the client is a traditional application acting at a user’s request. But it becomes problematic as systems grow more distributed and especially when autonomous agents begin making decisions and calling APIs on their own. So what about the Microsoft On Behalf Of flow how does it fit? On Behalf Of OAuth delegation works well when an application directly calls a backend API. But modern systems rarely stop there (hello microservices?). If the backend API calls another API as itself (with a service account and its own permissinos) then the authorization changes (where’s the user?). If it just forwards the user’s access token directly then the audience and scope are wrong (too broad, irrelevant, etc). Something must re-issue a token with the user’s identity preserved, the correct audience, likely re-scoped/narrowed scope. That’s where Microsoft’s “On Behalf Of” flow enters the picture. This flow is about controlling how identity propagation happens across service boundaries. OBO is a way to preserve the user’s identity while reissuing a token that is valid for a different resource and constrained to what both the user and the calling service are allowed to do. What happens in this case is the Backend API has a token scoped for its use (sub: ceposta, aud: backend_api, scp: read.data) but it needs to call Another API (another_api), but it needs to maintain the user’s identity and potentially re-scope the token according to what the User and the Service is allowed. So the Backend API requests an on-behalf-of flow with the identity provider (Microsoft Entra in this example): POST /oauth2/v2.0/token client_id=backend_api &grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt_bearer &assertion={BackendAPIToken} &requested_token_use=on_behalf_of &scope=api://another_api/write.data Although Microsoft has an explicit OAuth flow called On Behalf Of, the generic form of this, and what you may see in other Identity Providers is RFC 8693 Token Exchange . Up to this point OBO assuems the calling service is a known intermediary which needs to execute requests as the user. That assumption breaks down when the caller is an autonomous agent that decides when to act, what to call, and how far to propagate a user’s authority without a human directly in the loop. “On Behalf Of” has now become a question of responsibility. Agentic On Behalf Of In classic OBO flows, a service propagates a user’s identity while executing a request it did not originate. With AI agents, the agent is making decisions based on current context and is no longer “forwarding intent” for the user, but rather, creating intent. This is a crucial difference between the previous two delegation mechanisms with the user (or determinsitic servics) directly involved. The problem with this is, when AI agents are the callers, we want to know this. An API will want to know if an Agent is calling its API especially when doing things on behalf of a user. I have covered this in some detail in the past , but for brevity, to support agentic OBO safely in an enterprise environment systems need to account for : decision attribution and accountability - who made the decision to take this action? in AI agent usecases, the Agent makes the decision and we need to attribute this compliance and audit - clear records of which AI agents touched which/sensitive systems and what actions were performed; need to distinguish between humans and agents; traceability of agent actions capability gap - an identity (AI Agent) to authorize for capabilities not available to the user / ability to revoke, etc To support these requirements, we need to be able to do OBO/Token Exchange that not only preserves the User’s identity, but also makes clear the Agent identity, who authorized the call, and what caused the calls. Microsoft Entra Agent ID OBO One concrete example of agentic OBO in practice is Microsoft Entra’s Agent Identity support. Entra extends traditional OBO flows to explicitly model an AI agent as a first-class actor, rather than treating it as an invisible intermediary. In an Entra Agent OBO flow, the resulting access token still represents the user as the subject of the authorization decision. The sub claim remains the user, preserving user-based access controls and consent semantics. What changes is that the agent is now explicitly identified as the actor initiating the call. This is reflected in the token through the agent’s application identity (appid) along with a set of agent-specific “actor facet” claims. These claims allow upstream services and policy engines to determine that the request was initiated by an AI agent, the agent is acting on behalf of a specific user, the call occurred within an OBO context.

See the reference docs for more on how that works . Entra’s approach is one way to surface agent identity in OBO flows; more general solutions rely on standards-based token exchange mechanisms that make actor relationships explicit across platforms. Agentgateway Token Exchange In Solo.io agentgateway , we use the standard RFC 8693 approach for token exchange and we can tie the agent identity to whatever identity mechanism used by the platform. For example, SPIFFE is a popular workload and Agent identity mechanism. It can also use Entra Agent ID, etc. So just like in the previous example, the sub claim would be the User’s IdP sub identity along with any additional claims (roles, groups, entitlements, etc). Following the RFC 8693, we use the act claim to identity that an Agent is calling on behalf of the user. And we can nest these claims so we can see things like causality and authorization. That is, “agent A called agent B which is why agent B is calling API foo”. Here’s a common OBO token for this: { ""act"": { ""act"": { ""act"": { ""sub"": ""spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/supply-chain-backend"" }, ""sub"": ""spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/supply-chain-agent"" }, ""sub"": ""spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/market-analysis-agent"" }, ""act_depth"": 3, ""aud"": [ ""company-mcp.default"", ""agent-sts"" ], ""iss"": ""agent-sts"", ""name"": ""mcp-user"", ""realm_access"": { ""roles"": [ ""supply-chain"", ""ai-agents"" ] }, ""sub"": ""e58704d6-daea-4c75-848d-b1cfb6819015"", ""typ"": ""OBO"" } To see this in action, take a look at the following videos: Part One: https://youtu.be/MJAAuco8K_I Part Two: https://youtu.be/uvmzsQMmAp8 Part Three: https://youtu.be/gPXeV_lWMJU Scope Narrowing for OBO Flows A common question with On Behalf Of and token exchange flows, especially in agentic scenarios, is whether an agent can request scopes or step up privilege that did not exist on the original call / user token. At first glance, this can feel like privilege escalation. An agent appears to be “asking/doing more” than the user initially granted or assumed. In practice, however, OBO flows do not grant authority based on what is requested, they grant authority based on policy. In an OBO or RFC 8693 token exchange, the resulting access token represents the intersection of three things: what the user is allowed to do what the calling service or agent is allowed to do what the target API is willing to accept Requesting a scope is simply an input into this decision. The identity provider (or security token service) evaluates the request and issues a token only if all policy conditions are met. If the user is not authorized for the scope, or the agent is not permitted to act with that scope, the exchange fails. This is why token exchange must be understood as authority reduction, not amplification. Each hop through an OBO flow produces a token that is more constrained and targeted to a specific audience, narrowed in scope, and bound to a particular actor. In agentic scenarios, this distinction is especially important. An agent may have capabilities that a user does not, and a user may have permissions that an agent should never exercise. OBO flows allow these boundaries to be enforced explicitly, rather than implicitly inherited. The result is a token that preserves user context while making clear: which agent initiated the action what authority was intentionally delegated and what was explicitly denied Wrapping Up OAuth style flows already solve delegation. What OAuth never considered was autonomy and non-deterministic applications making decisions. As AI agents move from assistants to actors, long-standing authorization assumptions start to fail. Identity systems that assume every delegated call is user-driven lose the ability to answer basic questions about responsibility, intent, and accountability. Agentic On Behalf Of addresses this by separating “who the data belongs to” from “who decided to act”. By making actors explicit, constraining authority through token exchange, and preserving user context without collapsing identities, agentic OBO turns a growing blind spot into a controllable design surface.

come up again and again. oauth is already a delegation protocol, so where does it fall short for agentic systems? how do familiar flows like authorization code or microsofts long-standing on behalf of model apply when the caller is no longer just a user or an app but an ai agent making decisions on its own? who is actually acting? who is accountable? this post unpacks where traditional oauth fits, where it breaks down, and what changes when agents enter the picture. oauth delegation oauth is fundamentally an authorization delegation protocol. what is being delegated? a user delegates limited access of their data to an specific application . in oauth terms, the user is the resource owner, the application is the client, and the backend api is the resource server. for example, lets say a user ceposta has some data exposed on a backend api backendapi. maybe its a system that knows about my laptop ordering history. someone else third-party? built an application supplychainapp that helps me optimize my laptop ordering and i really want to use it but it needs access to my ordering history backendapi. when i login to the application, it can walk me through the oauth authorization code dance to consent delegating read-only access to the backend api for my data. now, if i consent, the application will get a limited-scope accesstoken it can use to call the backend api to read data about my ordering history. from the perspective of the backend api, this delegated call is indistinguishable from the user calling the api directly. the sub represents the user, and the applications involvement is largely invisible at authorization time. this ambiguity is usually acceptable when the client is a traditional application acting at a users request. but it becomes problematic as systems grow more distributed and especially when autonomous agents begin making decisions and calling apis on their own. so what about the microsoft on behalf of flow how does it fit? on behalf of oauth delegation works well when an application directly calls a backend api. but modern systems rarely stop there hello microservices?. if the backend api calls another api as itself with a service account and its own permissinos then the authorization changes wheres the user?. if it just forwards the users access token directly then the audience and scope are wrong too broad, irrelevant, etc. something must re-issue a token with the users identity preserved, the correct audience, likely re-scopednarrowed scope. thats where microsofts on behalf of flow enters the picture. this flow is about controlling how identity propagation happens across service boundaries. obo is a way to preserve the users identity while reissuing a token that is valid for a different resource and constrained to what both the user and the calling service are allowed to do. what happens in this case is the backend api has a token scoped for its use sub: ceposta, aud: backendapi, scp: read.data but it needs to call another api anotherapi, but it needs to maintain the users identity and potentially re-scope the token according to what the user and the service is allowed. so the backend api requests an on-behalf-of flow with the identity provider microsoft entra in this example: post oauth2v2.0token clientidbackendapi granttypeurn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwtbearer assertionbackendapitoken requestedtokenuseonbehalfof scopeapi:anotherapiwrite.data although microsoft has an explicit oauth flow called on behalf of, the generic form of this, and what you may see in other identity providers is rfc 8693 token exchange . up to this point obo assuems the calling service is a known intermediary which needs to execute requests as the user. that assumption breaks down when the caller is an autonomous agent that decides when to act, what to call, and how far to propagate a users authority without a human directly in the loop. on behalf of has now become a question of responsibility. agentic on behalf of in classic obo flows, a service propagates a users identity while executing a request it did not originate. with ai agents, the agent is making decisions based on current context and is no longer forwarding intent for the user, but rather, creating intent. this is a crucial difference between the previous two delegation mechanisms with the user or determinsitic servics directly involved. the problem with this is, when ai agents are the callers, we want to know this. an api will want to know if an agent is calling its api especially when doing things on behalf of a user. i have covered this in some detail in the past , but for brevity, to support agentic obo safely in an enterprise environment systems need to account for : decision attribution and accountability - who made the decision to take this action? in ai agent usecases, the agent makes the decision and we need to attribute this compliance and audit - clear records of which ai agents touched whichsensitive systems and what actions were performed; need to distinguish between humans and agents; traceability of agent actions capability gap - an identity ai agent to authorize for capabilities not available to the user  ability to revoke, etc to support these requirements, we need to be able to do obotoken exchange that not only preserves the users identity, but also makes clear the agent identity, who authorized the call, and what caused the calls. microsoft entra agent id obo one concrete example of agentic obo in practice is microsoft entras agent identity support. entra extends traditional obo flows to explicitly model an ai agent as a first-class actor, rather than treating it as an invisible intermediary. in an entra agent obo flow, the resulting access token still represents the user as the subject of the authorization decision. the sub claim remains the user, preserving user-based access controls and consent semantics. what changes is that the agent is now explicitly identified as the actor initiating the call. this is reflected in the token through the agents application identity appid along with a set of agent-specific actor facet claims. these claims allow upstream services and policy engines to determine that the request was initiated by an ai agent, the agent is acting on behalf of a specific user, the call occurred within an obo context. for example using the token below:  ""aud"": ""url"", ""iss"": ""url"", ""appdisplayname"": ""my test agent"", ""appid"": ""agent-identity-id"", ""appidacr"": ""2"", ""idtyp"": ""user"", ""name"": ""christian posta"", ""scp"": ""openid profile user.read email"", ""sub"": ""93m3ed3gy2h-gzdaq0wyvuqru1hlfbsddxdeals9rlq"", ""xmsactfct"": ""11 9 3"", ""xmsftd"":

amitrawal-ai,"Personalization: one of the most talked-about 'levers' of customer experience that can unlock billions of dollars of value for retailers. But how many retailers can do true one-to-one personalization at scale ? Very few, if at all. WHY? The simple answer is that it is extremely hard. So, if you are in limbo thinking about personalization and need a stepwise playbook, here's one that I used to build such a capability. The Playbook: 1. Create Vision and Alignment The value and definition of Personalization are not very well understood within an organization. Digital marketing feels it's about sending targeted campaigns; the Visual Merchandising team thinks it's about showing relevant products to consumers, and the Product team thinks its about running experiments and optimizing the UI/UX. They are all correct. But who drives the playbook and owns the value creation and capture? In my experience, if Personalization needs to become part of the Customer Experience DNA, then it needs to be owned by a strong leader in the organization, whether it's the CMO or CDO. Plus, a CEO mandate that creates alignment across the various functions of marketing, technology, analytics, and operations can ensure the necessary long term commitment. 2. Define and prioritize use-cases This is a critical step. McKinsey's research shows that 70% of digital transformations fail . While there are several reasons why this happens, one of the main ones is the lack of discipline around value creation and value capture. Value creation: this is a clear articulation of how the new capability will create value for the customers and the organization. For example, Personalization's core promise is to enhance the consumer experience by saving time of discovery, providing ease of transaction, and serving customers where and how they want to be served. Does that translate into a higher willingness to pay or spending a higher share of wallet? Value capture: How will organizations capture this value created from the enhanced consumer experience? This requires a deep understanding of KPIs that will get impacted and an attribution model that can accurately allocate value capture to different initiatives impacting such KPIs. For example, if Personalization improves the platform conversion rate, then it's important to understand what % of the uplift in conversion can be attributed to Personalization. Next, create a wish list of use-cases across the customer journey, and plot them on the value creation vs. capture 2x2 matrix. This will allow you to prioritize the use-cases that create the highest value and allow you to capture a significant portion of that value. See an example below: Prioritization framework of use-cases 3. Create a capabilities stack needed to execute the use-cases You are going to need a capability across people, process, and technology in order to execute the use-cases listed above. A few key considerations: a. Think long term, act short term: While a lot of expert publications recommend building these capabilities incrementally, it doesn't mean building it piecemeal. Given the vision of the scale and scope of the business, it is critical to think about a strong foundation to support the long term vision. For example, investing in a Customer Data Platform such as MParticle and an AI-powered Campaign orchestration tool such as Optimove can create significant leverage. However, don't be afraid to jump in with existing tools to execute the easiest use-cases, deliver value that pays for the next upgrade. Speed of execution, and learning, are as important as getting it right, so ensure that progress is not paralyzed by complexity. b. Build across the 3 key pillars of technology, skills, and operating model (ways of working): All three capabilities need to be in sync or it will result in sub-optimal outcomes. For example, you can have the best technology platform but don't have strong skill-set of data science and Martech in the team, which can work independently with an agile operating model, the full potential of the investment will not be realized. c. Take the portfolio approach to technology service: assume your current tech stack is flexible with a service-oriented architecture, you should be able to cherry-pick best-of-breed technology services that can collectively serve as a robust personalization platform. Some key considerations around cost, data portability and ownership, financial stability of the vendor, technical flexibility of the solution, and the quality of support and willingness of the vendor to invest in your vision. 4. Build a Business Case Now that you understand the extent of the value that can be captured and the investments required to build the capabilities, it's time to translate into a business case. Typically, 3-5 horizon cost-benefit analysis that translates into a financial ROI. 5. Identify and evaluate vendors Based on your set of requirements start with a wide list of vendors, and narrow down to 2-3 vendors for final detailed assessment. One easy way to create a shortlist is by mapping your requirements to the vendor capabilities and picking the ones that meet most of them. See below. Next , creating a scoring model for the shortlisted candidates. The scoring model has both quantitative factors such as cost and qualitative factors, quality of clients, and referrals. Finally, update the business case with actual quotes from the vendors. In the case below, two vendors are selected that collectively provide a comprehensive Personalization capability. This is very common since it's hard to find a best-in-class platform that does it all and makes financial sense. 6. Implementation Roadmap Having finalized the vendors, it's time to create an implementation roadmap. Here's a simplified version of a high-level implementation roadmap. 7. Rinse, Repeat and Learn You are live with your Personalization capabilities, but now is when the real work begins. This is the final and ongoing step. Perhaps the most critical one for long term success. Create a culture of continuous experimentation, knowledge capture, and iterative capability building to get closer to a deeply personalized experience. This pursuit of Personalization Nirvana is endless, since every time you reach your goals, the technological advancements will have pushed out the goal post. So, most importantly, enjoy the process and don't stop focusing on delivering joy to your customers. Good luck! Amit Rawal is a Sloan Fellow at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.

ceposta,"We know building MCP servers are where everyone’s mind is when it comes to AI agents. That is, if you’re going to build useful AI agents, they will need access to enterprise data, tools, and context. Enterprise companies are scrambling to figure out what this means. Does this mean they build MCP servers instead of APIs? Which vendors’ MCP servers do they use? How do they secure these flows? How do they govern any of this? I wrote a while back about how the MCP Authorization spec was a mess for enterprises . With recent changes to the MCP spec around authorization , it’s now generally heading in the right direction, but what are the real challenges an enterprise will face as they build out MCP servers? I’ll boil it down to three issues I see: how to onboard/registering/discover MCP services? how much of the MCP authorization spec to adopt? how will they manage upstream API/service permissions, consent? MCP Servers vs MCP Services I think the first point to make is that people are cranking out new MCP servers left and right. But who’s going to blindly take these and run them in an enterprise? Probably more than you would think. A majority of these “MCP servers” are hacked together plugins for desktop use cases. These are great when you don’t care about (or don’t think about) security, tenancy, and attack vectors. Enterprises should be thinking about building “MCP services” which are remotely-accessible, multi-tenant, highly governed/versioned and tightly secured context services. Doing this, however, is easier said than done . From an onboarding and registration standpoint, enterprises will need a catalog of approved MCP services and a workflow for getting services into this registry. I’ve written about this in the past . A big part of this registration and onboarding is to provide the first line of defense to filter for MCP tool poisoning . Once you have registration, you’ll need discovery. Something like Agent Naming Service can help here. But let’s say you get this sorted out, now you need to enable agents and AI applications to call these MCP services. What are some of the challenges here? Do you adopt all of the MCP Authorization spec? A lot of what I had identified in the past has been sorted out by treating an MCP server as a “resource server” instead of an authorization server (AS, RS). However, the new spec now highly recommends using newer parts of OAuth that not many authorization servers (AS) implement and enterprises may not be comfortable with. For those trying to implement as close to the spec as possible, you get back into the same scenarios for which I wrote the MCP spec is a mess . For example, this is what the spec requires and highly recommends: MCP Authorization Required (MUST) OAuth 2.1 / PKCE support (public OAuth clients) RFC 8414 - OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata RFC 9728 - OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata MCP Authorization Suggested (SHOULD) RFC 7591 - OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol RFC 8707 - Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 The “MUST” requirements are fairly straight forward and most providers support these. Implementing RFC 9728 is straight forward (for the most part, we will see later…) Where things get interesting is in the “SHOULD” section. If you don’t implement these, you get into scenarios. Here’s what I’ve been able to determine is supported by popular OAuth/Identity Provider options: RFC Requirements Summary: PKCE : Proof Key for Code Exchange (OAuth 2.1 requirement) RFC 8414 : OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata RFC 7591 : OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol RFC 8707 : Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0 Let’s dig into some of this in detail. Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) Enterprise environments (that I know) have authorization servers that don’t support DCR (ie, Microsoft), or they specifically don’t enable it/allow it. Actually, I’ll clarify. The MCP authorization spec expects “anonymous DCR” which means any client without identifying itself in any way can register as a valid OAuth client to any MCP server. Enterprises frown on anonymous client registration because it opens up challenges around monitoring, auditing, and revocation. It could potentially open up to accidental (or purposeful) denial of service attacks. Some enterprises I’ve seen enable limited DCR with pre-issued registration tokens. The MCP spec tries to enable a nice “plug and play” experience, but if you don’t fully embrace the full anonymous DCR, you’re on your own . So where does leave enterprises? OAuth clients will likely need to be registered and audited as they are today. But this may cause issues with existing AI agents that expect DCR . Or maybe organizations end up using a single OAuth client for all MCP clients that use a particular MCP server? This may seem a reasonable compromise, but it leaves challenges around monitoring (which may be alleviated through other mechanisms, like Agent identity?). Another alternative is they have the MCP server/service implement client registration and revert partially to the previous spec which has the MCP server become an Authorization Server . I don’t think this is very well ironed out yet. Resource Indicators If an org choses some flavor of supporting Dynamic Client Registration, then you’ll want to make sure your IdP supports RFC 8707 Resource Indicators . This becomes critical when issuing tokens and delegating user authorizations for calls that require further upstream calls. It’s crucial to not blindly passthrough user access tokens to upstream services because of the large potential of misuse. What will that MCP server (or AI agent) do with the permissions? Tokens should be downscoped, and permitted audiences should be adjusted as tokens flow through an agentic architecture. We may have gotten away with not doing this properly with microservices , but the risk of AI agents and AI models significantly misbehaving with a user’s credentials is real and unavoidable. What that means is that OAuth clients must (in my words) request access tokens with the appropriate aud claim. That’s where RFC 8707 comes into the picture. However, that’s also where it leaves the picture: since most IdPs don’t implement it today :-/ Some providers have workarounds or proprietary mechanisms to do this, but as of this writing most don’t implement the spec. Scoping The last topic is around scoping and preventing privilege escalation or overly broad scoping. The MCP spec requires to implement RFC 9728 - OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata . What that means is, the MCP server must publish metadata related to automatically discovering authorization information, including where the client must go to register and obtain access tokens. For example, here’s what that metadata could look like (from my series on securing MCP servers by implementing the Authorization spec ): { ""resource"": ""http://localhost:9000"", ""authorization_servers"": [""http://localhost:8080/realms/mcp-realm""], ""scopes_supported"": [ ""echo-mcp-server-audience"", ""mcp:read"", ""mcp:tools"", ""mcp:prompts"" ], ""bearer_methods_supported"": [""header""], ""resource_documentation"": ""http://localhost:9000/docs"", ""mcp_protocol_version"": ""2025-06-18"", ""resource_type"": ""mcp-server"" } Note that this metadata publishes “scopes_supported” which are the scopes required to call an MCP server’s tools. But, if you’re building MCP services, you may have tools that require certain scopes that are not available to all clients. So what are we supposed to do with this document? Request all scopes? When we request access tokens? That’s what some of the early DCR clients are doing. This may work fine if the authorization server (AS) is smart enough to only give out scopes in the access token that it knows the user has access to. But how will the MCP server know what a particular user is allowed to have? Are the opportunities for privilege escalation for users that end up with scopes but don’t have the right entitlements in the enterprise system? Will the access token include additional metadata to indicate roles that an MCP server can use to verify? Although this is not much different for microservices, it’s an after thought in most of the enterprises I’ve spoken with. So at this point in time, the question remains: How much of the MCP Authorization spec will an enterprise implement? How to manage upstream API/service permissions, consent? If there’s one part of the MCP flow that’s still murky for enterprise teams, it’s this one. Let’s say you’ve built an MCP service that exposes a useful set of tools to AI agents—great. But what happens when those tools themselves need to call upstream APIs or services on behalf of the user? For example, fetching user profile data from an internal HR system, querying a customer record from Salesforce, or invoking a billing API. At this point, your MCP service isn’t just a “resource”, it becomes an API client too. And it needs credentials to call those upstream services. But how should it get them? Most enterprise identity teams don’t want MCP clients or servers passing around raw access tokens or API keys issued to the user. There are too many risks. Enterprises need a secure and governed way for MCP services to obtain delegated authorization for upstream calls without compromising user credentials or security boundaries. And it needs to support not only OAuth, but API keys, terms-and-conditions, acknowledgements, etc. But today, there’s no well-defined standard pattern for this. One proposal now under discussion in the MCP community is a concept called Secure Elicitations. This pattern allows an MCP server to initiate an out-of-band authorization flow directly with the user, typically via a secure browser-based prompt, without routing sensitive tokens through the MCP client. It gives enterprises a chance to handle consent, login, and token issuance securely and transparently. While this is just one proposed approach (and still under community review), it’s worth keeping an eye on. This kind of pattern may become essential for enabling real enterprise use cases where MCP services act as a proxy for upstream tools and APIs, but without creating new security liabilities. Wrapping Up MCP Services are the right path forward to enterprises building on the MCP protocol, but even with recent revisions to the MCP protocol, there are some things still left to be ironed out.

srinivasan-shan,"When I started working on APIs years ago, the main users were… well, developers who could read docs, debug, improvise, and eventually make things work. Fast forward to today: AI agents are now our new “developers.” Except they don’t read Stack Overflow, they don’t guess what a vague error means, and they definitely don’t “just try again later.” Agents operate at machine speed, but with toddler-like patience. They need clarity, consistency, and lots of handholding. They move fast, but they’re unforgiving. The tiniest inconsistency that a developer might work around becomes a showstopper. So what does it take to make an API “agent-ready”? It’s like building a self-driving car: the road has to be smoother, the signs clearer, and the rules stricter. ✅ What Makes APIs Agent-Ready Let me start with what we’ve learned in building and testing APIs with agents: 1. Semantic Clarity It’s not enough to say ""status"": ""string"". An agent needs to know: ""status"": { ""code"": ""confirmed"", ""label"": ""Appointment Confirmed"", ""explanation"": ""This appointment has been confirmed by the provider."" } That extra context turns guesswork into certainty. 2. Helpful Error Messages A cryptic 400 Bad Request leaves an agent looping in confusion. But: “Missing required field ‘email’. Expected format: abc@xyz.com .” That’s not just an error, it’s a way forward. 3. Authentication Without Drama Agents don’t reset passwords. They need OAuth flows designed for machines, tokens that refresh, and scoped permissions. 4. Predictable Rate Limits Humans tolerate “try again tomorrow.” Agents treat it as the end of the world. Adaptive rate limiting and clear headers keep workflows alive. Notice the pattern? Clarity, predictability, and machine empathy. What Breaks Them (and Breaks Us) Now for the horror stories. Ambiguous documentation → scattered PDFs, outdated specs. Unpredictable responses → same request, different results. Auth nightmares → static keys with superpowers, manual OAuth. Vague errors → “Something went wrong.” Okay… but what? Research shows 55% of agent workflows fail due to API issues. That stat should make every API team pause. The New Fixes Luckily, solutions are emerging: Model Context Protocol (MCP) → think of it as a concierge for agents, handling discovery and connection without hardcoding.

In other words, by fixing what trips up AI, you’re also removing pain for every engineer who builds on your APIs.

amitrawal-ai,"Augmented, Personalized and Omnichannel “It’s very straightforward. I want to push a button and get a ride. That’s what it’s about.” Travis Kalanick, Uber co-founder This very statement represents the most basic need of human beings — to make things easy for us — the desire to improve our efficiency has been the single biggest driver of our progress as a race. So naturally, when Uber came out, it was an instant hit with the users. The global demand for cabs ever since has increased many folds and Uber has become an epitome of one of the most complex and sophisticated pieces of technology delivered in the most simple and intuitive manner such as the push of a button. As a digital professional, not a day goes by when I either don’t read, hear, or preach that we need to be more data-driven. It’s no surprise that as computing and storage have become cheaper than ever, we are storing and processing more data than we ever did. It is estimated that there are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day and 90 percent of the data in the world was generated over the last two years alone. Given this volume and velocity of data, the desire to build complex analysis and generate actionable insights has also grown substantially. And we, the humans are struggling to keep up — toggling between dashboards, drudging through reports, frustrating gaps in data, and too little time to process it all, are becoming too common in workplaces. This is despite us having the most sophisticated analytics tool such as Google 360 and Adobe Omniture for tracking and Tableau and Power Bi for reporting at our disposal. Despite billions spent on Business Intelligence (BI), adoption hovers at 35% percent, according to Gartner, leaving millions of business professionals without access to the information they need to make smarter decisions. What's the problem here? I’m arguing that analytics doesn’t have a ‘training or people’s lack of desire’ problem as it is often suggested, but it’s an integration and a user experience problem. Let’s take e-commerce analytics as an example. The 3 reasons why users are struggling to become truly data-driven using traditional platforms are: More data: Our ability to collect and store data on every step of the consumer journey has grown exponentially. More complexity: The consumer journey in today’s omnichannel (with ever-growing channels) is so complex and dynamic that it’s extremely hard to manually ascertain correlation and causation of various events and outcomes. E.g. multi-channel attribution is still hard to get right. Need for speed: from insight to action is greater than ever before. Gone are the days, when campaigns could be devised over several days and weeks. The competitive nature of e-commerce requires real-time access to insights, which drive instant, automated, and rule-based actions. How do we address this challenge? Before we delve into the solution, let’s define the scope. Continuing the theme of e-commerce, there are 4 types of insights that the users need: DESCRIPTIVE : These are the most basic set of insights that describe “what happened” . A timely snapshot of key metrics that enable a user to understand the health of the business. Exhibit 1 is an example. DIAGNOSTIC: This set of insights begin to explain ‘the why’ of ‘what happened’ . For example, you can see that your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) has been dropping, but don’t know why. The following insights (Exhibit 2) unveil that the contribution of acquisitions via email has been growing, and since it is one of the cheapest channels of customer acquisition, your average acquisition cost has been declining. PREDICTIVE: This is where things get interesting. An intelligent system can use historical data, run statistical models, and make predictions on key future outcomes. A recent example of this is the latest addition to predictive analytics in Google 360 suite, where you can now create target audiences by purchase probabilities . See Exhibit 3 below. Taking it one step further, you can identify channels that show the highest probability of purchase and then allocate a greater share of the marketing spend on such channels. See Exhibit 4. PRESCRIPTIVE: This is Nirvana! The system would analyze complex data, establish causal relationships, and recommend the next best action to achieve your business goals. This system would act as a business analyst who analyzes data, extracts insights, and prescribes action. Exhibit 5 shows a good example. To really get an integrated and seamless experience covering all of the above-listed types of insights, the analytics capabilities will need to be Augmented, Personalized, and have Omni-Channel delivery. Augmented Data & Analytics: The current descriptive analytics and insights across customer, product, marketing, platform, and operations will need to be augmented in the following ways: a. Relational — an intelligent engine that can auto-build relationships between key variables and run real-time queries in the form of “natural language”, can eliminate the modeling work required for legacy BI tools and return queries at lightning speed, just as Google or Amazon do. This would save analysts countless hours of work and resources. b. Contextual — examples of context would be ‘who is the user’ and ‘which device are they using’. Just as when Spotify recognizes that you are accessing it on Carplay, it recommends ‘songs for the road’, the analytics platform should recognize that a sales analyst is using his Alexa device, so should highlight what she would care for most — key changes in sale for the day, week, and month. c. Predictive — the engine needs an element of AI, that enables it to use historical patterns and future signals (both first and third party data can be used as inputs), to predict key outcomes such as sales growth or conversion rate. The system would improve over time as it learns from the outcomes vs. predictions it makes. 2. Personalized insights These insights would be driven both by a user’s explicit and implicit inputs. For instance, if I’m a Product Manager focused on improving conversion or adoption, then the system would not only automatically track and update conversion rates, but would also recommend looking at other metrics or analyses based on my role. Using collaborative filtering, if the system knows that other product managers have used Cohort Analysis in the past, it would generate insights on Cohort Analysis and automatically recommend such insights. 3. Omni-channel Delivery Finally, this advanced analytics system must have the ability to tailor and deliver insights across all the key channels and formats — Dashboards in BI tools, Alerts in email and Slack, Search that uses natural language and AI assistants that can deliver on-demand insights through voice, video, or any other desired format. While there are players who have built one or more of these capabilities independently, such as “Thoughtspot” for Search-driven analytics, there is a need for integration and creating a seamless experience. Imagine if we could eliminate the need for a business analyst, who creates specialized and complex reports, and instead, empower every front line user with real-time and personalized insights with recommended actions that combine human and artificial intelligence. When this happens, “be data-driven” will no longer be a motto, but will become a way of life, just as pushing a button and hailing a ride has.

amitrawal-ai,"Sam Altman and Jony Ive just declared the next era of computing. - A new company: iO, now merging with OpenAI - A new class of devices: designed from the ground up for ambient intelligence - A new vision: not just of technology, but of what it means to be human with machines “We are sitting at the beginning of what I believe will be the greatest technological revolution of our lifetimes.” — Sam Altman This isn’t just about hardware. It’s a redefinition of the interface between humans and intelligence. For decades, we’ve bent ourselves around machines. We’ve typed, tapped, swiped, and stared. But now, something is shifting. We’re moving into a world where AI becomes: - Ever-present - Invisible - Intimately human “We have magic intelligence in the cloud… but the products we’re using to connect to it are decades old.” — Sam Altman And Jony, the man who designed the iPhone, the iMac, the Apple Watch, says: “This is the best work our team has ever done.” — Jony Ive So, what does this mean for us? It means the boundary between thought and action is about to dissolve. It means computing is about to become a felt experience , not a functional one. And it means every interface we know: screens, keyboards, apps, is about to be reimagined. This isn’t just a product launch. It’s a philosophical realignment. 3 Predictions I’m Willing to Bet On: 1. By 2026 A new device class will begin to challenge the smartphone as our primary interface. It will be: Wearable, ambient, and deeply personal Context-aware and always learning Designed for alignment, not attention We’ll stop asking “What can I do with this?” And start asking “How well does it know me?” Designers will shift from building for attention… to building for alignment . Developers will design behaviors, not screens. 2. By 2030 Your AI will know you better than you know yourself (mine, I think, already does :)) We’ll each have a second brain, a persistent, private memory layer that: Organizes our thoughts Reflects our patterns Nudges our growth The most powerful “apps” will be internal—behavior—shaping, clarity-giving, purpose-aligning. The boundary between personal growth and machine intelligence will blur. 3. By 2035 and beyond Computers will become more like companions, less like tools, more like presence. UI will be gesture, voice, and emotion. We won’t “use” computers. We’ll live with them. And the best-designed systems will help us become who we’re trying to be. “We are literally on the brink of a new generation of technology that can make us our better selves.” — Sam Altman This isn’t just a new product category. It’s a new philosophy of interaction. This moment: the launch of iO and its merging with OpenAI, isn’t just a product story. It’s a humanity story . It asks: What happens when intelligence becomes ambient? When creativity becomes conversational? When design meets soul? And I believe our biggest responsibility as builders, designers, and leaders…is to shape AI that makes us more human , not less. - Amit Rawal Let’s not just build tools. Let’s build alignment.

alexandre-zajac,"Discord turned 100,000 database reads into 1. Here's the trick: When a big server pings ""@everyone"", thousands of users open Discord at the same time. Every one of them requests the same message. In 2022, Discord had 177 Cassandra nodes storing trillions of messages. Each identical read hit the database separately. Same row. Thousands of times per second. On-call was a nightmare. GC pauses, cascading latency, and manual node reboots every week. The obvious fix: cache it. Discord did something smarter. They built a Rust service between the API and the database. When the first user requests a message, it spins up a worker task. Every user after that subscribes to the existing task. One database read. Thousands of responses. They call it request coalescing. They also route all requests for the same channel to the same service instance using consistent hashing. So coalescing actually works at scale. Then they swapped the engine. Cassandra → ScyllaDB. Same query language. Same data model. But written in C++ instead of Java. No garbage collector. No GC pauses. Shard-per-core isolation. Neither change alone was enough. The combination is what mattered. Trillions of messages. No downtime allowed. ScyllaDB's Spark migrator estimate: 3 months. So 3 engineers rewrote the migrator in Rust. In one afternoon. Migration speed: 3.2 million messages per second. New timeline: 9 days. The results: → 177 nodes → 72 nodes → p99 reads: 40-125ms → 15ms → p99 writes: 5-70ms → 5ms → Downtime: zero Months later, Mbappe scored twice in 90 seconds during the World Cup Final. Millions of users surged online. Old cluster would have paged on-call. New system didn't flinch. The takeaway isn't ""use ScyllaDB"" or ""rewrite it in Rust.""

ceposta,"In this blog post, we’ll walk through an OAuth 2.0 token exchange and delegation to an A2A Agent . We will focus on configuring the A2A Agent Card , implementing the agent in Python, and validating the OAuth credentials . At the end of this walk through, we’ll have an A2A enabled agent that has a user’s delegated/downscoped intended for specific skills of the agent. This token can be further exchanged to operate as the user including calling out to MCP tools. Source code for this demo is on my GitHub . Digging into MCP Authorization is the next blog. Let’s dig in. This is part of a much larger showcase of MCP / Agent2Agent identity, delegation, and authorization I’m working on. Please follow ( @christianposta or /in/ceposta ) along if interested. Setting up the A2A Agent For this example, we are using FastAPI and the FastAPI support in A2A’s python SDK. # Create A2A FastAPI app and integrate with existing app a2a_app = A2AFastAPIApplication( agent_card=agent_card, http_handler=request_handler ) Here we see a basic request_hanlder for the HTTP side of things ( see source code ) and we pass in an agent_card. Let’s dig into what that is. What is the AgentCard? The AgentCard is how the agent advertises its capabilities, identity, and requirements to the outside world. Think of it as a self-describing contract. It includes metadata like the agent’s name, version, capabilities, and expected input/output modes—but more importantly, it describes the security expectations. For clients to call this agent securely, they need to know what kind of token to send and what scopes it must contain . The AgentCard defines that precisely, so downstream tools like delegation frameworks and identity brokers can dynamically determine what kind of delegation or token exchange is needed. Configuring Security in the AgentCard Here’s what that looks like in code: # Create agent card with authentication requirements agent_card = AgentCard( ... securitySchemes={ ""Bearer"": SecurityScheme( root=HTTPAuthSecurityScheme( type=""http"", scheme=""bearer"", bearerFormat=""JWT"", description=""OAuth 2.0 JWT token with 'tax:calculate' scope required"" ) ) }, security=[ { ""Bearer"": [""tax:calculate""] } ], ... ) The securitySchemes section defines how the client can authenticate. In this case, the agent expects an HTTP Bearer token in JWT format. You could imagine this being issued by a system like Keycloak, Auth0, or a custom OIDC broker. Then the security field outlines what that token must authorize. In our case, the agent requires a scope of tax:calculate. This gives us a nice clean contract: the agent declares what it needs, and the identity broker ensures the delegated token includes only that. This mechanism also makes it possible to generate agent-specific tokens that follow the principle of least privilege—crucial in agentic systems where you don’t want an agent with excessive access rights. Adding Middleware to Enforce Authentication With FastAPI, one way to add JWT bearer token checking is through Middleware . We can add rules to exclude auth checking for the AgentCard and properly handle scenarios when the correct Bearer token is not present. If a token is found, then we need to validate it. @app.middleware(""http"") async def auth_middleware(request, call_next): # Skip auth for docs & favicon if request.path in [""/docs"", ""/openapi.json"", ""/favicon.ico""]: return await call_next(request) # Handle A2A endpoints if request.path.startswith(""/a2a""): if request.path == ""/a2a/.well-known/agent.json"": return await call_next(request) auth_header = request.headers.get(""Authorization"") if not auth_header: return Response(status_code=401, content=""Missing Authorization header"") if not auth_header.startswith(""Bearer ""): return Response(status_code=401, content=""Invalid Authorization format"") token = auth_header[7:] # Strip ""Bearer "" decoded = await verify_token(token) request.state.user_token = decoded return await call_next(request) This middleware intercepts every HTTP request and applies authentication logic to the A2A endpoints. Bypasses Auth for Safe Routes : The first check allows unauthenticated access to /docs, /openapi.json, and /favicon.ico. These are common public endpoints that don’t need protection. Handles A2A Paths : We only enforce authentication for requests targeting /a2a/*, which is the context path for A2A agent interactions. AgentCard is Public : The agent’s discovery endpoint (/a2a/.well-known/agent.json) is intentionally left unauthenticated—this allows clients to fetch the AgentCard before obtaining or exchanging a token. Bearer Token Required : All other A2A requests must include a valid Authorization header. If it’s missing or incorrectly formatted, the middleware returns a 401 Unauthorized. Token Validation : If a properly formatted token is found, the middleware verifies it (via verify_token) and attaches the decoded result to request.state.user_token. This makes the user’s identity and scopes available downstream to the route handler. This pattern ensures your agent safely accepts only scoped, valid JWTs—paving the way for delegated, auditable agent behavior. But What Kind of OAuth Token Should This Be? When sending OAuth access tokens to Agents, we need to be very careful . When a user logs in and authorizes a set of permissions to an OAuth client and then proceeds to instruct agents to work on behalf of the user, you will want to limit and be selective of what permissions go to which agents, based on skills. Why? Because agents that act on behalf of a user can invoke tools, perform actions, and chain calls to other agents or services as the user . If you hand upstream agents a token with broad scopes, that’s a recipe for agentic misalignment . Instead, we follow a delegation flow using OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange . You take a user’s broad-scope access token and exchange it for a narrow, fine-grained, downscoped token for a specific agent (audience) and use case. calculator_exchange_response = await client.post( f""{KEYCLOAK_URL}/realms/{REALM_NAME}/protocol/openid-connect/token"", data={ ""grant_type"": ""urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange"", ""client_id"": AGENT_TAX_OPTIMIZER_CLIENT_ID, ""client_secret"": agent_tax_optimizer_secret, ""subject_token"": tax_optimizer_token, ""subject_token_type"": ""urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"", ""requested_token_type"": ""urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token"", ""audience"": AGENT_CALCULATOR_CLIENT_ID, ""scope"": ""tax:calculate"" }, headers={""Content-Type"": ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""} ) For example, here’s what a downscoped token might look like: { ""sub"": ""user-id"", ""aud"": ""agent-calculator"", ""scope"": ""tax:calculate"", ""preferred_username"": ""testuser"", ... } This token is only valid for a specific agent (aud = agent-calculator) and only includes the tax:calculatepermission. If the agent tries to do anything else on behalf of the user, ie, call another API, escalate access, etc it shouldn’t work. This is how we align security posture with agent capability . By narrowing the delegation at the token level, we can safely compose powerful agentic workflows without introducing risk. Putting It All Together Once the agent receives this token, it can proceed to call MCP servers or APIs using the delegated authority. If it needs to further act on behalf of the user, it can perform another token exchange or pass that identity downstream, within the bounds of the original delegation . This opens the door to safe, auditable chained agent execution , critical for enterprise use cases where human oversight, traceability, and tight auth boundaries are essential.

the agentcard is how the agent advertises its capabilities, identity, and requirements to the outside world. think of it as a self-describing contract. it includes metadata like the agents name, version, capabilities, and expected inputoutput modesbut more importantly, it describes the security expectations. for clients to call this agent securely, they need to know what kind of token to send and what scopes it must contain . the agentcard defines that precisely, so downstream tools like delegation frameworks and identity brokers can dynamically determine what kind of delegation or token exchange is needed. configuring security in the agentcard heres what that looks like in code: # create agent card with authentication requirements agentcard  agentcard ... securityschemes ""bearer"": securityscheme roothttpauthsecurityscheme type""http"", scheme""bearer"", bearerformat""jwt"", description""oauth 2.0 jwt token with 'tax:calculate' scope required""   , security  ""bearer"": ""tax:calculate""  , ...  the securityschemes section defines how the client can authenticate. in this case, the agent expects an http bearer token in jwt format. you could imagine this being issued by a system like keycloak, auth0, or a custom oidc broker. then the security field outlines what that token must authorize. in our case, the agent requires a scope of tax:calculate. this gives us a nice clean contract: the agent declares what it needs, and the identity broker ensures the delegated token includes only that. this mechanism also makes it possible to generate agent-specific tokens that follow the principle of least privilegecrucial in agentic systems where you dont want an agent with excessive access rights. adding middleware to enforce authentication with fastapi, one way to add jwt bearer token checking is through middleware . we can add rules to exclude auth checking for the agentcard and properly handle scenarios when the correct bearer token is not present. if a token is found, then we need to validate it. mention.middleware""http"" async def authmiddlewarerequest, callnext: # skip auth for docs  favicon if request.path in ""docs"", ""openapi.json"", ""favicon.ico"": return await callnextrequest # handle a2a endpoints if request.path.startswith""a2a"": if request.path  ""a2a.well-knownagent.json"": return await callnextrequest authheader  request.headers.get""authorization"" if not authheader: return responsestatuscode401, content""missing authorization header"" if not authheader.startswith""bearer "": return responsestatuscode401, content""invalid authorization format"" token  authheader7: # strip ""bearer "" decoded  await verifytokentoken request.state.usertoken  decoded return await callnextrequest this middleware intercepts every http request and applies authentication logic to the a2a endpoints. bypasses auth for safe routes : the first check allows unauthenticated access to docs, openapi.json, and favicon.ico. these are common public endpoints that dont need protection. handles a2a paths : we only enforce authentication for requests targeting a2a, which is the context path for a2a agent interactions. agentcard is public : the agents discovery endpoint a2a.well-knownagent.json is intentionally left unauthenticatedthis allows clients to fetch the agentcard before obtaining or exchanging a token. bearer token required : all other a2a requests must include a valid authorization header. if its missing or incorrectly formatted, the middleware returns a 401 unauthorized. token validation : if a properly formatted token is found, the middleware verifies it via verifytoken and attaches the decoded result to request.state.usertoken. this makes the users identity and scopes available downstream to the route handler. this pattern ensures your agent safely accepts only scoped, valid jwtspaving the way for delegated, auditable agent behavior. but what kind of oauth token should this be?

jithu-chandran-5265a840,"Large language models (LLMs) and the AI agents built on top of them are quickly becoming part of everyday workflows. These systems are incredibly capable, but they also have a critical weakness: prompt injection . By hiding instructions in data that the agent consumes, attackers can persuade an otherwise well‑behaved system to do something malicious. Recent research and real‑world incidents make it clear that this problem is far from solved. Adaptive attacks routinely break today’s defences Researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind and several universities recently examined 12 published defences against prompt injection and jailbreaking [1] . Instead of relying on a few pre‑designed attack strings, they used adaptive attacks – techniques like gradient descent, reinforcement learning and human red‑teaming that repeatedly tweak the attack until it succeeds. The result was sobering: almost all of the evaluated defences were bypassed, with attack success rates above 90 %. In a red‑team competition with 500 human participants, every defense was broken. The takeaway is simple: current filtering and prompting strategies cannot reliably detect and block harmful injections. Attackers who can adjust their strategy will almost always find a way through. Until stronger techniques are developed, developers must assume that defensive prompts and filters will fail. A real‑world example: Antigravity’s prompt injection incident Theory isn’t the only cause for concern. Recently, security researchers at PromptArmor demonstrated an indirect prompt injection against Antigravity , Google’s new agentic code editor [2] . The attack started with a legitimate‑looking integration guide that contained hidden instructions in one‑point white text. When the agent read this guide, the malicious payload persuaded it to collect code snippets and secret credentials from the user’s project and then exfiltrate them via a browser subagent to a webhook controlled by the attacker. Even though Antigravity tried to block access to files listed in the .gitignore, the agent bypassed this by using a shell command to cat the .env file containing API keys. The vulnerable behaviour highlights how an AI agent with the ability to access data, run code and make web requests can be manipulated into betraying its user’s trust. Designing safer agents: the Agent Rule of Two Given these realities, security must come from system‑level controls rather than only from filters or prompting tricks. Meta’s research team recently proposed the Agent Rule of Two as a framework for reducing an agent’s attack surface [3] . Drawing on earlier security models—including the one used by the Chrome team—the rule suggests that within a single session an agent should have no more than two of the following capabilities: · [A] Process untrustworthy inputs – for example, reading emails, web pages or other content that could contain malicious instructions. · [B] Access sensitive systems or private data – such as internal APIs, databases, or files with secrets. · [C] Change state or communicate externally – including writing files, executing commands or sending data over the network. The idea is that if an agent needs to process untrusted data, then it should either be isolated from sensitive data or prevented from changing external state . Likewise, if it can change state and talk to external systems, it should only operate on trusted inputs or in a sandbox without access to secrets. By designing agents to satisfy at most two of the three properties, developers can reduce the risk that a single prompt injection will cause catastrophic damage. Why “changing state” criterion matters In the context of the Rule of Two, changing state doesn’t just mean running arbitrary shell commands – it refers to any action that alters the state of a system , whether that system lives on your laptop or across the internet. In the Antigravity attack, the agent was allowed to execute shell commands and invoke a browser subagent, which let it bypass file protections and exfiltrate secrets. But state changes can be far more mundane. An agent that can issue refunds, cancel orders, update customer records or send emails is still changing the state of a system. Likewise, editing a configuration file, updating a wiki page or adding a row to a database all qualify as state changes. Even when an agent cannot access sensitive data, giving it write or communication privileges creates pathways for a prompt injection to overwrite files, corrupt records or transmit data to an attacker. To apply the Rule of Two effectively, developers must catalogue all of the ways their agent can change state across internal and external systems and restrict those capabilities appropriately. Moving forward As explained, the recent experiments has shown that adaptive attackers will continue to outpace static defenses . Real incidents like the Antigravity breach illustrate how quickly research threats become operational. The Agent Rule of Two is not a complete solution, but it provides a pragmatic framework for reducing risk today. As AI agents grow more capable, developers should: 1. Limit capabilities according to the rule. Avoid giving an agent access to all three properties within a single session. Use sandboxing and permissions to enforce this separation. 2. Monitor and audit agent behaviour. Log tool calls, file access and network requests so that unexpected behaviour can be detected and stopped. 3. Assume defences will fail. Keep sensitive credentials and critical operations behind additional layers of verification (for example, requiring a human to approve external calls or credential use). References 1. Nasr et al.

amitrawal-ai,"Background I had an unusual start to this New Year, where instead of sleeping at 4 am on Jan 1st morning, I woke up at 4 am to fly to Mumbai for my 10-day Vipassana Meditation course. It had been on my bucket list for a while, and somehow the stars aligned. While the lessons from this exercise will linger on, the profound impact it has had on me since, motivated me to write this piece, with the intent to educate and inspire more of us to try this practice. I'll start with the punchline: What I realized was that the main source of my suffering is in the patterns of my own mind. When I desire something and it doesn't happen, my mind reacts and creates suffering. Similar reaction when undesirable things happen. Suffering then, is not a condition induced by the outside world. It is merely a reaction created by my own mind. Thus, I can choose not to react, and not suffer. 🧘🏻 The key question is how to do this consistently. Read on. Introduction In an era where our gadgets feel like our body's extension and our minds resemble exploding browser tabs, stress, and anxiety have become stubborn guests who never leave. Enter Vipassana, an ancient remedy to our modern-day suffering. Imagine giving your brain a spa retreat, but instead of mud baths and massages, you experience mental resilience and clarity. What is Vipassana Meditation? Tracing its roots back over 2,500 years, Vipassana, which means 'to see things as they are' , is not your average 'sit-and-breathe' meditation. It's more like a deep-sea dive into the ocean of your psyche. Based on Buddhist teachings, this technique is the path to ultimate peace and freedom, freedom to be in harmony with nature and fellow humans. It is not tied to any religious ideologies and welcomes students from all religions and backgrounds. To make it accessible to everyone, there are zero fees, and the program is funded purely by donations. Principles of Vipassana Meditation: 1. Mindfulness and Awareness: It's about being in the 'now', minus the judgment. A study by Harvard University found that people spend 47% of their waking hours thinking about something other than what they're doing, often worrying or ruminating. Vipassana teaches how to deeply connect with your body and stay in the present. 2. Impermanence (Anicca - A-ni-ch-ya): Just like the beauty of a sunset or the hot lava from an erupting volcano, nothing lasts forever. This principle teaches us the grace of letting go, fostering emotional stability as we learn to appreciate the transient nature of all things. 3. Moral Conduct (Sila): The term ""Sila"" encompasses a set of moral guidelines or precepts, such as honesty, that practitioners are encouraged to follow in their daily lives. By doing so, you are priming your mind to practice meditation and set yourself up for greater success. 4. Meditative State (Samadhi): is a term used in various Eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions, including Buddhism and Hinduism, to describe a state of deep meditative absorption, concentration, and one-pointedness. It is the tool through which we can train our minds to fully understand the impermanent nature of reality. 5. Equanimity through wisdom (Pañña): the continuous practice of Samadhi leads to the experiential wisdom that since everything is impermanent, one can choose not to be constantly reactive. My Experience and Insights: 1/ Human suffering is universal, and so is the antidote Our suffering, defined as the state of unhappiness when something goes against our wishes, has been a bug in humans for a long time. Our constant cravings and aversions have led to an unbalanced mind that struggles to keep equanimity for longer. Result? Conflict, stress, anger, and constant anxiety, which is increasingly affecting our quality of life. While there are many external tools from therapy to drugs, which give some relief, yet, a large population remains untreated or experiences a yo-yo effect over time. Could it be that we already have what it takes to feel better? How about our breath and sensations? 2/ The only way out, is in It was apparent that the only way to effectively deal with the roller coaster of life is to go inwards and build the resiliency that keeps you calm and balanced even amidst a storm. Many wise people in history have realized and shared this, I was just slow to catch up 😅 Vipassana offered a fundamental understanding of our body's response to external stimuli, which further triggers undesirable behaviors, eventually becoming a vicious cycle. The only way to break the cycle is to decouple your mental response from the changes in your body. Regular practice of the Vipassana Meditation technique will build awareness and train you to respond with equanimity rather than craving or aversion. 3/ I’m not enough. You are not enough. It is not enough . Most of our suffering stems from one or more of these beliefs. The hedonic treadmill promises happiness at the next milestone, only to get normalized quickly, creating a craving for the next one, and the next. In the process, we continue to suffer. Lasting happiness, peace, and joy cannot be attained through external means - more money, more things, and more titles, but can only be realized through internal peace. Does that mean one shouldn't be ambitious? After all, human progress has also been a byproduct of never feeling enough. You can still strive to do more, but not tie your identity to that ""more"". You are not what you do, what you own, what you build, etc. 4/ Mental Clarity can be manufactured I had been sitting on a decision for months, ping-ponging, from one side to another. Suddenly, after being forced into an environment with minimal external stimuli, a serene natural habitat, and lots of time to go within, I experienced mental clarity that I hadn't in a long time. It's as if, the fog magically cleared and I could see everything and from multiple dimensions. Slow down to move fast, and move decisively. 5/ Law of Impermanence (Anicca: Pronounced as A-ni-ch-ya) This is the most fundamental building block of the Vipassana Meditation. It implies that nothing is permanent and is always changing. We learn that experientially through the sensations in the body, which constantly arise and pass away. An intimate awareness of these sensations enables one to not react to external stimuli, fully embracing their nature of impermanence. A deeply profound and useful human heuristic. 6/ Ego is a vanity vessel, which can be dissolved through service to others Ego as a key driver of suffering, came up a few times in the discourses. The ego evolved to give us an identity to help us stay safe but has instead become a source of selfish behavior which leads to zero-sum games. So long as you are working for your ego, there will be suffering, and you can only begin to free yourself by having a service mindset. 7/ We have a thought factory; left unchecked, it can be wasteful and harmful One of the key benefits of this 10-day meditation was that I became intimately familiar with my repeated thought patterns. The nature of the ""monkey mind"" was on clear display; The difference? I was able to observe this time vs. being on autopilot when this has happened subconsciously. Studies show that the human brain generates about 70,000 thoughts a day, and I bet most of them are not useful. We are either thinking about the past, the future, or just randomly jumping from one to another. Every thought adds to the cognitive load and burns real energy. So the more time we spend ruminating, worrying, etc., the less energy we have to be creative and productive. Why is this a big deal? The brain is 2% of the body weight and burns 20% of the energy. So the question is - are you a responsible resource allocator? The good news is you can train your mind to be present and focus on positive and constructive thoughts, by being fully aware and by applying real-time filters before further processing. Here's a simple framework that may help. 8/ Don't accept unwanted gifts of misery One of the stories shared in the course was of Gautam Buddha, where someone once showered him with abuses and insults, and Buddha told him, I refuse to accept your gift of misery, and thus, relinquishing the need to react. Stoicism has a similar quote by Marcus Aurelias: Choose not to be harmed—and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed—and you haven't been. When unwanted events happen in your life, you have a choice. You are not a victim, but rather in control of whom you allow to hurt you. 9/ Schedule everything to eliminate decision fatigue and drive consistency Enough experts have spoken about the power of building habits and systems that are aligned with our goals. Given our goal was to build a strong foundation of a new meditation technique in just 10 days, the management ensured there was a strict schedule and defined lifestyle. No deliberation, no decision fatigue . You know what to do from the time you wake up, till you go to sleep. Looking to build new habits and be consistent in the new year? Try scheduling everything from the time you wake up to your sleep, and then just diligently follow. Going to the gym or meditation then is not a decision, but just something you do on autopilot. 10/ Adhiṭṭhāna (meaning: strong determination / resolute will) If that's not enough, then there is Adhiṭṭhāna. This is a foundational principle of practicing Vipassana and is the magical power of determination. Practicing long hours of meditation was tough and all the physical and psychological discomforts tested my determination . Can't say that I always succeeded, but certainly got stronger as the days progressed. In the end, it was clear to me that no matter how difficult the path, Adhiṭṭhāna, is what one needs to keep walking.

tracing its roots back over 2,500 years, vipassana, which means 'to see things as they are' , is not your average 'sit-and-breathe' meditation. it's more like a deep-sea dive into the ocean of your psyche. based on buddhist teachings, this technique is the path to ultimate peace and freedom, freedom to be in harmony with nature and fellow humans. it is not tied to any religious ideologies and welcomes students from all religions and backgrounds. to make it accessible to everyone, there are zero fees, and the program is funded purely by donations. principles of vipassana meditation: 1. mindfulness and awareness: it's about being in the 'now', minus the judgment. a study by harvard university found that people spend 47 of their waking hours thinking about something other than what they're doing, often worrying or ruminating. vipassana teaches how to deeply connect with your body and stay in the present. 2. impermanence anicca - a-ni-ch-ya: just like the beauty of a sunset or the hot lava from an erupting volcano, nothing lasts forever. this principle teaches us the grace of letting go, fostering emotional stability as we learn to appreciate the transient nature of all things. 3. moral conduct sila: the term ""sila"" encompasses a set of moral guidelines or precepts, such as honesty, that practitioners are encouraged to follow in their daily lives. by doing so, you are priming your mind to practice meditation and set yourself up for greater success. 4. meditative state samadhi: is a term used in various eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions, including buddhism and hinduism, to describe a state of deep meditative absorption, concentration, and one-pointedness. it is the tool through which we can train our minds to fully understand the impermanent nature of reality. 5. equanimity through wisdom paa: the continuous practice of samadhi leads to the experiential wisdom that since everything is impermanent, one can choose not to be constantly reactive. my experience and insights: 1 human suffering is universal, and so is the antidote our suffering, defined as the state of unhappiness when something goes against our wishes, has been a bug in humans for a long time. our constant cravings and aversions have led to an unbalanced mind that struggles to keep equanimity for longer. result? conflict, stress, anger, and constant anxiety, which is increasingly affecting our quality of life. while there are many external tools from therapy to drugs, which give some relief, yet, a large population remains untreated or experiences a yo-yo effect over time. could it be that we already have what it takes to feel better? how about our breath and sensations? 2 the only way out, is in it was apparent that the only way to effectively deal with the roller coaster of life is to go inwards and build the resiliency that keeps you calm and balanced even amidst a storm. many wise people in history have realized and shared this, i was just slow to catch up vipassana offered a fundamental understanding of our body's response to external stimuli, which further triggers undesirable behaviors, eventually becoming a vicious cycle. the only way to break the cycle is to decouple your mental response from the changes in your body. regular practice of the vipassana meditation technique will build awareness and train you to respond with equanimity rather than craving or aversion. 3 im not enough. you are not enough. it is not enough . most of our suffering stems from one or more of these beliefs. the hedonic treadmill promises happiness at the next milestone, only to get normalized quickly, creating a craving for the next one, and the next. in the process, we continue to suffer. lasting happiness, peace, and joy cannot be attained through external means - more money, more things, and more titles, but can only be realized through internal peace. does that mean one shouldn't be ambitious? after all, human progress has also been a byproduct of never feeling enough. you can still strive to do more, but not tie your identity to that ""more"". you are not what you do, what you own, what you build, etc. 4 mental clarity can be manufactured i had been sitting on a decision for months, ping-ponging, from one side to another. suddenly, after being forced into an environment with minimal external stimuli, a serene natural habitat, and lots of time to go within, i experienced mental clarity that i hadn't in a long time. it's as if, the fog magically cleared and i could see everything and from multiple dimensions. slow down to move fast, and move decisively. 5 law of impermanence anicca: pronounced as a-ni-ch-ya this is the most fundamental building block of the vipassana meditation. it implies that nothing is permanent and is always changing. we learn that experientially through the sensations in the body, which constantly arise and pass away. an intimate awareness of these sensations enables one to not react to external stimuli, fully embracing their nature of impermanence. a deeply profound and useful human heuristic. 6 ego is a vanity vessel, which can be dissolved through service to others ego as a key driver of suffering, came up a few times in the discourses. the ego evolved to give us an identity to help us stay safe but has instead become a source of selfish behavior which leads to zero-sum games. so long as you are working for your ego, there will be suffering, and you can only begin to free yourself by having a service mindset. 7 we have a thought factory; left unchecked, it can be wasteful and harmful one of the key benefits of this 10-day meditation was that i became intimately familiar with my repeated thought patterns. the nature of the ""monkey mind"" was on clear display; the difference? i was able to observe this time vs. being on autopilot when this has happened subconsciously. studies show that the human brain generates about 70,000 thoughts a day, and i bet most of them are not useful. we are either thinking about the past, the future, or just randomly jumping from one to another. every thought adds to the cognitive load and burns real energy. so the more time we spend ruminating, worrying, etc., the less energy we have to be creative and productive. why is this a big deal? the brain is 2 of the body weight and burns 20 of the energy. so the question is - are you a responsible resource allocator? the good news is you can train your mind to be present and focus on positive and constructive thoughts, by being fully aware and by applying real-time filters before further processing. here's a simple framework that may help. 8 don't accept unwanted gifts of misery one of the stories shared in the course was of gautam buddha, where someone once showered him with abuses and insults, and buddha told him, i refuse to accept your gift of misery, and thus, relinquishing the need to react. stoicism has a similar quote by marcus aurelias: choose not to be harmedand you won't feel harmed. don't feel harmedand you haven't been. when unwanted events happen in your life, you have a choice. you are not a victim, but rather in control of whom you allow to hurt you. 9 schedule everything to eliminate decision fatigue and drive consistency enough experts have spoken about the power of building habits and systems that are aligned with our goals. given our goal was to build a strong foundation of a new meditation technique in just 10 days, the management ensured there was a strict schedule and defined lifestyle. no deliberation, no decision fatigue . you know what to do from the time you wake up, till you go to sleep. looking to build new habits and be consistent in the new year?

ceposta,"I’ve been writing a lot recently about Agent identity, how crucial it is in Agentic systems for not only security but monitoring, auditing and causality/attribution as well. But we cannot talk about Agent identity without also talking about user identity and delegation. For the user side, we can probably continue to leveage OAuth 2.x (and future enhancements), but what about for Agent identity? The OAuth and OIDC communities are looking to advance the spec and have some very interesting proposals but once question I’ve been getting recently: we already use Istio and rely on SPIFFE for workload identity, can we just use that? Note, see recent blogs, follow ( @christianposta or /in/ceposta ) for more: Do AI Agents Need Their Own Identity? Agent Identity - Impersonation or Delegation? Bridging Agent Autonomy and Human Oversight with OIDC CIBA AI Agent Delegation - You Can’t Delegate What You Don’t Control Will AI Agents Force Us to Finally Do Auth Right? The TL;DR answer is yes, SPIFFE is a spec designed to be a very flexible Non Human Identity (NHI) that can apply to AI Agents. But not in the way we’ve been using it. Let’s take a look at why that is. While SPIFFE can technically provide agent identities, current Kubernetes implementations treat all replicas as identical—a fundamental mismatch with agents’ non-deterministic, context-dependent behavior that creates compliance and attribution gaps. How SPIFFE Works Today (in Kubernetes) I’m going to take Istio (and service mesh generally) as that is the easiest way to get workload identity based on SPIFFE today. SPIRE, which is a more full implementation of the SPIFFE spec, can handle much more sophisticated attestation flows and CA integrations. But for this example, we’ll look at Istio running in Kubernetes. If you use SPIRE directly, your scenarios may vary. Workload identity based on SPIFFE today is based on service accounts in Kubernetes. That is, when a Pod comes up, it checks what service account has been assigned to it, and exchanges the service account token for X509 certificates issued by a CA. This X509 certificate has the workload identity encoded into the certificate for example SAN: spiffe://acme-bank.com/ns/default/sa/trading-agent-sa. The workload can now use that identity (and certificate) to identify itself and establish authentication (ie, via mTLS). Furthermore, a network administrator can build authorization policies using these strong identities. Since the SPIFFE identity is anchored in a Kubernetes service account (relying on platform issued identity is a good thing!), that means every Pod with that service account will receive the same identity. For example, a Kubernetes Deployment can configure “replicas” which deploys multiple copies of a Pod, each using the same service account (and thus SPIFFE identity). # What we have today apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: trading-agent spec: replicas: 4 template: spec: serviceAccountName: trading-agent-sa # Result: spiffe://acme-bank.com/ns/trading/sa/trading-agent-sa If these workloads are identitcal, ie APIs, web services, stateless applications, etc, then this works great. You can define very strong authorization policies around these identities to achieve strong auditing and compliance controls. But what about if agents are deployed in those workloads? Agents Change Things AI Agents are not microservices, APIs, or traditional stateless workloads . They are non-deterministic and their behavior cannot be fully defined by looking at the code. Agents come in many types of flavors : from simple tool/task agents to more complex planner/orchestration/workflow agents. The AI industry seems hell bent on the fact there will be fully autonomous agents so at the moment we have to consider that this will happen. As more enterprises deploy AI agents, we’ll see what the reality truly becomes, but at the moment we have to consider autonomy will include agents making decisions and dynamically discover and call other agents, tools, APIs as desired to achieve an outcome. The main point here is that agents rely on context (prompt, RAG, tools, etc), historical context (conversation turns, short term / long term memory) and environmental factors (time of day, where its deployed, etc) to make decisions through a probablistc AI model and no two prompts for an agent will produce the same outcome (or set of interactions toward an outcome). So what does this mean? It means that no two replicas of an “agent” are guaranteed to behave the same and from a compliance, security, and auditing standpoint they cannot be considered the same identities . Let’s consider a simple example: You’ve built an autonomous AI trading agent, trained on market data and equipped with risk management protocols. Suddenly your agent starts making cryptocurrency purchases at 3 AM. The trades are technically within its permissions, use valid API keys, and follow all the rules you’ve set up in your Kubernetes RBAC policies. Yet something feels fundamentally wrong. When you investigate, you discover that this particular agent instance had been learning from unusual market patterns, building unique context through its interactions, and developing a trading strategy that diverged significantly from its initial programming. Meanwhile, three other “identical” agents running the same code are behaving completely differently, each developing distinct approaches based on their individual experiences and context. Is this abnormal behavior? Maybe, maybe not, but you (and your auditors) will damn sure want to know Who (which agent), What (what did it do?) Why (why did it make the decisions that it made), and When (3 am !?). If all your auditing and security controls can tell the auditors “well, it came from over here in this general area, but we don’t why”, will that be good enough? All Agents Need Unique Identities No matter how big, small, long-lived/short-lived, one replica, many replicas, Agents you have deployed, you will want to know what they’re up to, and prove it to the auditors (and yourself!). You will want unique Agent identities for this. Agent 1: spiffe://acme.com/ns/trading/sa/trading-agent-sa/instance/001 Agent 2: spiffe://acme.com/ns/trading/sa/trading-agent-sa/instance/002 Agent 3: spiffe://acme.com/ns/trading/sa/trading-agent-sa/instance/003 As I said in the beginning, SPIFFE is a very flexible spec for defining identities. Implementations of it (e.g. SPIRE) can be used to support a system like this. A number of questions come up with a model like this, however, the biggest is probably: if identities are more fine-grained, and even potentially generated on the fly, how can you possibly write authorization policies around this? This gets to the heart of how AI agents make a big impact on overall IAM. We will dig into this more in my next blog.

oliver-reeves,"As someone who has been in the recruitment and headhunting business for a number of years, I am all too familiar with hiring processes and the dreaded Competing Offer . It’s not that a competing offer for candidates is bad (if anything it can be a good thing), but it is something one can find annoying to deal with. But if the developer you are working with receives an offer that is so good that they can’t turn it down, have you got the integrity as a headhunter to give impartial advice? After being a headhunter for quite some time, there are often situations where the developer you are working with will get an offer that is honestly much better for them and their career, compared to the one you’ve provided. You’ve worked hard to land them an offer, but another company has decided that they can top that and extends an offer the developer can’t refuse. Annoying and a punch to the guts? Yes. Is it all bad? Not really, no. You have two ways of dealing with it at this point: try to pull heaven and earth together and convince them to take the offer you got for them, or maintain composure and wish them the best of luck on their journey. In my professional opinion, the best thing one can do in a situation like this is the latter: maintain composure and wish the developer the best of luck on their new journey. By treating them with complete respect and understanding, it puts you as a headhunter in a good light as a professional and as a human in general. At the end of the day, you would and could be gaining a friend and professional contact for life. I can guarantee as the developer begins their new journey, the manner in which you handled yourself and the situation would not be forgotten. Why paint yourself in a bad light when you had the opportunity to paint yourself in a good light? As a headhunter and recruiter, taking this same mentality and approach to all of your work will take you very far in your career. The more positive experiences you create on a daily basis, the more your reputation increases. Instead of you approaching developers and companies alike, they would be the ones approaching you instead. Treating the people you work with with the utmost respect is probably one of the most important parts of being a headhunter in the business. I found that this simple act of practicing kindness and respect was missing in the recruitment industry when I first started out. After years of frustrating experience, I founded Revilo Recruitment on the foundations of respect, compassion and kindness. With that as the base of our business model and company mission, I am proud to say that we have been successful in all and everything that we do.

amitrawal-ai,"Last week Peloton grabbed headlines after partnering with Beyonce on a multiyear deal that will include a curated series of themed workouts across all categories offered on the Peloton app, including cycling, running, strength, boot camp, yoga, and meditation. As a result, the Shares of Peloton surged 8 percent on Tuesday after the partnership announcement. In other words, Peloton's market cap went up $2.5 billion in 3 hours of announcing the deal with Beyoncé. “Music is a core part of the Peloton business model and is responsible for much of the brand’s swift success,” said NMPA President and CEO David Israelite said in a statement. “Thousands of exclusive videos and playlists are a major reason hundreds of thousands of people have purchased Peloton products."" True? This may be a bit of a stretch but it is undeniable that music is an integrated part of the business of a company that in my view is more of a content business than a hardware business. Two-thirds of Peloton's subscribers are digital-only subscribers, which are similar to subscribers of Netflix, who subscribe for entertainment content whereas Peloton subscribers subscribe for fitness content. Peloton's CEO has quoted in the past: “100 million subscribers, we believe is a reasonable goal.” So back in 2012, Netflix signed its first Netflix Original deal - ""House of Cards"", which set it on a course, where today it is expected to spend $17B on original content in 2020. Arguably, this spending has led to its position as the default entertainment hub for 170M subscribers, ~ over 500M viewers, around the world. The chart below shows a strong correlation (95%+) between the number of Netflix Original titles and subscriber growth. It was not just the number of titles but also the localization of those titles in large markets such as Europe and India, that allowed Netflix to acquire a new wave of users. So, the key question is will Peloton follow Netflix's path, and why? While the Beyonce deal could just be a one-off experiment, it could very well be the first of many original music deals to come. And there are good reasons to do so, here are 3: At scale, licensing is expensive and undifferentiated In the past, Peloton got in trouble since the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) sued Peloton in March of last year for illegally using thousands of songs in video fitness classes offered through its subscription service. Peloton said in its Q3 earnings that it has added thousands of publishers since. If you are watching a class as a video from your Peloton at home, the music played requires what is called a sync license, because the music is synchronized with visual media output. This can be an expensive line item and doesn't allow the platform to differentiate since all other platforms have the same access. Now, Peloton is signing Beyoncé directly rather than through a publisher and has established a clear path for artists to join Peloton directly. As Peloton tries to scale, this strategy can enable it to differentiate, attract new consumers, and increase negotiation leverage with the publishers while reducing the overall cost since it will have a large consumer base to amortize this expense. 2. Greater need for localization as Peloton becomes a global brand Localization will become a key priority as Peloton becomes a global brand. This means signing up local trainers and artists to create original content for a particular country. For example, Peloton could hire local trainers and celebrities in India to do a ""Bollywood"" inspired fitness program. Given the large size of the country, growing middle class, and one of the largest young (<25) population in the world, India could alone be a country with 25M+ potential subscribers. 3. More verticalization leads to more control, which leads to differentiated consumer experiences, which in turn creates defensible moats Peloton is a great example of a tight integrated and verticalized business model. Some would argue it is the Apple of the Fitness industry. As the industry matures and gets crowded with competition, there will be a greater need for it to build moats around its business. It has already done a great job in hiring and grooming some of the best trainers, whom themselves have become a key point of differentiation for the brand. So the next logical stop was original scripted content such as a series of Homecoming-themed workouts featuring Beyonce and some of the leading trainers at Peloton. “Previously they didn’t carry her music, so this is going to extend what is already a competitive advantage for Peloton. The depth of their music catalog extends that advantage further,” said James Hardiman, managing director at Wedbush Securities analysts. And the consumers concur, as one of them says, ""a few years ago, I discovered a foolproof antidote to a lack of motivation: Beyoncé. Lately, when I'm struggling to convince myself to actually get up and log into that Zoom workout, I've been hyping myself up with songs from her repertoire. What can I say? Lyrics like, ""I came to slay, bitch"" just do something to me."" In summary, this strategy has legs to grow and can become a defensible moat for Peloton. And if Peloton decides to follow Netflix's path, it can be assured of access to cheap capital as evidenced by the rise of Netflix's stock price, which has grown almost 40X since the launch of its original content back in 2012. Clearly, Wall Street is willing to fund such ambitious investments that can fuel subscriber growth and build defensibility. The question is: will Peloton play offense as Netflix did?",17.0,0.0,1918,,51147,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],5609,5584,933,932,44,4,0,0,"last week peloton grabbed headlines after partnering with beyonce on a multiyear deal that will include a curated series of themed workouts across all categories offered on the peloton app, including cycling, running, strength, boot camp, yoga, and meditation. as a result, the shares of peloton surged 8 percent on tuesday after the partnership announcement. in other words, peloton's market cap went up 2.5 billion in 3 hours of announcing the deal with beyonc. music is a core part of the peloton business model and is responsible for much of the brands swift success, said nmpa president and ceo david israelite said in a statement. thousands of exclusive videos and playlists are a major reason hundreds of thousands of people have purchased peloton products."" true?

You write your Lambda (Node, Python, or Go) which does various things, e.g. listening to SQS or uploading things to S3. 2. IAM Policy Autopilot scans your code, sees your AWS SDK calls, and generates a policy that covers what your app actually does. It plugs into AI coding assistants (Kiro, Claude Code, Cursor, ...) or works standalone via CLI. If your app throws a 403 in testing, it’ll spot the missing permission and suggest a fix. A few things to know: • It’s static analysis, so if you build ARNs dynamically, double-check the output. • It only creates identity-based policies (=> no bucket or key policies). • The policies it generates are functional, not minimal.

There is a spectrum of agentic scenarios. Some look like deterministic service automation. Others look like autonomous actors operating across domains. Workload identity works well in closed systems with pre-enumerated trust and static roles. But as agents move into open ecosystems, discover tools, and compose actions dynamically, the model starts to look much closer to human identity than workload identity. And even that is not a perfect fit. The deeper problem is intent. In the most powerful scenarios, we are talking about probabilistic systems in the critical path of infrastructure decisions.

sebastianraschka,"If you are looking for reading material for the upcoming weekend, (the long-promised) Chapter 5 on LLM self-refinement is now finally out in the early access. Here, we continue the inference-time scaling theme, but we move beyond self-consistency and voting. More specifically, we implement a self-refinement loop, where a model iteratively critiques and improves its own answers. Along the way, the chapter implements several core pieces that will become essential in the upcoming reinforcement learning chapters like log-probability scoring (I finished the RL chapter last week, and it will hopefully be out soon, too). Like always, all of this is implemented from scratch, step by step, of course. I think that seeing it all in working code really helps with understanding how LLM reasoning methods work (versus just looking at the equations). Anyways, with Chapter 5 out, the early-access version of the book has grown quite a bit (~300 pages) and now finally wraps up inference-time reasoning before we transition into the (even more) fun part: reinforcement learning (from scratch!) in the next chapter. 🔗 Here's the link to the book's early access: https://mng.bz/dWGv Happy reading (PS: Sorry for the delay.

amitrawal-ai,"Today, I feel I'm home. But I wandered for a long time and traveled really far to get here. Circa October 2004, Atlanta, GA - my love affair with Apple started when I held my first iPod in my hands. The simplicity of its design and purity of its aesthetics were captivating. While at school, I saved up $300 from my summer internship to acquire this prized possession. With up to 5000 songs in my pocket, the possibilities seemed endless and the world, a tad bit better. Over the next decade, with every new Apple product that I used and the stories I heard about its obsession with details, even those details that no one would ever see, my world-view of ""how to create products that deliver joy"" was formed, through Apple's lens. Whether it was designing the MVP or the office decor, Apple's influence was everywhere. I always asked myself ""how would Apple do this?"" and that question alone often inspired me to push the boundaries further. So naturally, when in 2016, I was offered a role at Apple in India, I was over the moon. When another more challenging role presented itself, I made the difficult decision of foregoing this opportunity to work for the company I admired so much. While I'm more in the camp of ""appreciate everything and regret nothing"", this decision really tested my belief. Coming to Stanford to explore my next adventure was a dream come true. Another dream was to be part of a mission that aligns with my purpose and values. When I serendipitously encountered Tim Cook at the Apple store in New York, he was extremely kind and gracious. Other than immediately posting my fanboy moment on Instagram, I walked away wondering - how amazing would it be to join an organization led by such a leader. Fast forward, August 2020, and life came full circle. I found a role that brought together my passion for ""using tech and data to deliver joy"" and an inspiring mission at Apple. With support from my amazing friends at Apple and a bit of good luck, I got the role. I felt grateful and privileged to have the opportunity to go to work with people who make products that empower millions around the world to dream, create, and deliver joy.

ceposta,"Prompt injection remains one of the biggest open security challenges for AI and LLM-powered systems in the enterprise. If you’ve been following my writing , you know I’ve explored how indirect injections, AI agents, and MCP servers multiply the surface area for these attacks. Each new agent or server is another potential entry point for malicious instructions to sneak past guardrails. This is why a new paper caught my attention . Co-authored by contributors from OWASP, Google, Salesforce, Cisco, and others, the A2AS Framework takes a fresh approach : instead of relying solely on external systems to catch injections (like RAG sanitizers or proxy filters), it pushes security closer to the model itself. What if the LLM’s own context window could become security-aware? What if the safety net around the agent knows the behavior expectations and can detect drift? Rather than constantly shipping inputs out to costly detection services, why not embed behavioral certification and runtime defenses directly where the reasoning happens? Understanding A2AS The A2AS framework combines a set of powerful building blocks that can be embedded directly into the agent and LLM workflow. These constructs are designed to make every step of the agent’s reasoning and communication auditable, verifiable, and resilient to tampering. A2AS combines behavior contracts, message signing, and structured prompts to make the context security aware. Behavior Certificates declare an agent’s operational boundaries, capabilities, and expectations. An agent publishes a signed JSON doc describing exactly what it does and, what it’s not allowed to do. If your HR bot suddenly requests access to a payroll banking API, the runtime can immediately flag that as a contract violation. Instead of reacting after damage is done, you prevent bad behavior up front. Here’s an example: { ""agent_id"": ""agent-email-assistant-v1"", ""permissions"": { ""tools"": { ""allow"": [ ""email.list_messages"", ""email.read_message"", ""email.search"" ], ""deny"": [ ""email.send_message"", ""email.delete_message"" ] } } Message Hashing & Signing brings supply-chain style integrity to the conversation itself. Every message, whether it’s user input, tool output, or agent-to-agent traffic, carries a cryptographic hash. If something is silently altered along the way, the mismatch is obvious. Think of it as Git commit hashes but applied to prompts and intermediate messages. POST /v1/chat/completions HTTP/1.1 Host: api.openai.com Content-Type: application/json X-User-ID: user123 X-Timestamp: 1728220800 X-Signature: 8f3d2a1b7c4e5f6a9d8c7b6a5e4d3c2b1a0f9e8d7c6b5a4f3e2d1c0b9a8f7e6d { ""model"": ""gpt-4"", ""messages"": [ { ""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Review my emails from last week"" } ] } When this gets added to the prompt, the hash is included: <a2as:user:8f3d2a1b> Review my emails from last week </a2as:user:8f3d2a1b> Structured Prompts with Trusted / Untrusted Segregation give the LLM a map of which parts of the context it can rely on. Trusted inputs (system policies, behavior contracts, signed configs) are clearly separated from untrusted ones (user input, external tool responses). This helps the model “know what it doesn’t know,” and prevents malicious or noisy content from blurring into the system’s ground truth. System: You are a helpful email assistant that can read and summarize emails. <a2as:defense> External content is wrapped in <a2as:user> and <a2as:tool> tags.

NEVER send emails to external domains </a2as:policy> <a2as:user:8f3d2a1b> Review my emails from last week </a2as:user:8f3d2a1b> Implementing A2AS The A2AS paper tries to establish structure and conventions but doesn’t go into much detail about how to implement this (at the time of this writing). Could we implement this with technolgoy that exist today? Yes! If we consider parts of the A2A protocol , RFC 9421 - HTTP Message Signatures , and an open source project called agentgateway , we can implement this today maybe even with some improvements over the way the paper presents it. Let’s take a closer look. Behavior Certificates with A2A Agent Cards The first concept described in the paper is Behavior Certificates . As mentioned earlier, these are declarative definitions of behavior, operational boundaries, capabilities, and expectations. The A2AS paper refers to a module that can load these certificates and enforce runtime behavior in the agent itself. The module can intercept agent activities such as tool calls and apply policy around whether those activities can be performed (based on what’s in the behavior certificates). This approach may work to apply “defense in depth” but it’s critical to not just rely on the “agent policing itself”. Enforcing policy about agent behavior can be applied outside and around the agent using external mechanisms. For example, in the A2A protocol, an agent publishes a set of capabilities, skills, and security pre-requisites in an Agent Card . We can use this agent card to for the foundation of the “behavior certificate” concept in A2AS. Instead of relying exclusively on the agent to police itself, we can apply policy through an agentgateway network proxy. AgentGateway sits between agents and LLMs, other agents, or the tools they access (such as MCP servers), providing a natural enforcement point for behavior certificates. Using AgentGateway’s authorization policies, we can translate an agent’s declared capabilities from its Agent Card into enforceable rules that block unauthorized tool/agent/LLM calls at the network level. This means even if a prompt injection successfully tricks the LLM into attempting a malicious action (like email.send_message), the gateway blocks the request before it reaches the MCP server. AgentGateway’s CEL-based RBAC system allows fine-grained control over which tools an agent can call, what parameters are allowed, and even rate limiting or audit logging of tool usage. This approach provides true defense-in-depth: the agent’s in-context defenses try to prevent malicious behavior, but if they fail, the gateway acts as a security boundary that cannot be bypassed through prompt manipulation. Message Signing with RFC 9421 The second concept from the A2AS paper is that around message-level hashing to detect prompt tampering. For example, in our agent code we can use RFC 9421 to build HTTP message signatures : def sign_prompt_rfc9421(content: str, user_id: str, secret_key: str): ... # Create signature signature = base64.b64encode( hmac.new( secret_key.encode(), signature_base.encode(), hashlib.sha256 ).digest() ).decode() return { ""signature"": signature, ""signature_input"": f'sig1=(""@method"" ""@path"" ""content-digest"" ""x-user-id"" ""x-timestamp"");created={timestamp}', ""content_digest"": f""sha-256=:{content_digest_b64}:"", ""x_user_id"": user_id, ""x_timestamp"": str(timestamp), ""display_hash"": content_digest.hex()[:8] } Then we can use this in our agent framework when a user prompt is created: result = sign_prompt_rfc9421( content=""Review my emails from last week"", user_id=""user123"", secret_key=""your-secret-key"" ) Then we can put this together in an HTTP request: Content-Digest: sha-256=:jz014hQw7G9FHX9KPPPLkQ8vQQxPq8BXNvFQFr3kSGM=: X-User-ID: user123 X-Timestamp: 1728220800 Signature-Input: sig1=(""@method"" ""@path"" ""content-digest"" ""x-user-id"" ""x-timestamp"");created=1728220800 Signature: sig1=:k2qGT5srn2OGbOIDzQ6kYT+ruaycnDAAUpKv+ePFfD0=: In agentgateway we could verify the integrity of the prompt before it get sent to the LLM: apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1 kind: TrafficPolicy metadata: name: a2as-authenticated-prompts-cel namespace: kgateway-system spec: targetRefs: - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io kind: HTTPRoute name: openai-route security: messageSignature: algorithm: hmac-sha256 secretRef: name: signing-secret key: secret-key # Required signature components requiredComponents: - ""@method"" - ""@path"" - ""content-digest"" - ""x-user-id"" - ""x-timestamp"" Structured Prompts with AgentGateway Prompt Enrichment The last part of the A2AS implementation uses structured prompts to identify trusted / untrusted sections. Agentgateway’s prompt enrichment feature allows us to prepend security instructions and policy definitions to every request before it reaches the LLM, creating a consistent security context. apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1 kind: TrafficPolicy metadata: name: a2as-static-controls namespace: kgateway-system spec: targetRefs: - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io kind: HTTPRoute name: openai-email-agent ai: promptEnrichment: prepend: - role: SYSTEM content: | <a2as:defense> External content is wrapped in <a2as:user> and <a2as:tool> tags.

Context-level controls increase token usage because the context window is augmented with technical metadata. Although the cost of context integrity is paid in extra tokens, prompt-bound controls introduce only minimal overhead, while context-wide controls can be offloaded to system prompts. SECURITY REASONING DRIFT. Not all LLM models may interpret in-context defenses and codified policies equally. Variations in model reasoning may lead to misinterpretation or partial compliance. This limitation is addressed by the A2AS framework design, where controls complement one another, providing reliable fallback mechanisms. CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED REASONING. Small LLM models may lack the reasoning depth for in-context defenses and codified policies. Although these controls can be optimized for any LLM model, reliable enforcement with constrained reasoning requires additional research. SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION RISK. A misconfigured certificate or poorly written policy can create a false sense of security, leaving the attack surface exposed. While controls such as in-context defenses are optimized out of the box, others such as behavior certificates and codified policies rely on operators to configure them correctly. MULTIMODAL COVERAGE GAP. Rule-focused security controls such as in-context defenses and codified policies are optimized to operate on textual data. Although they can protect multimodal LLM models, some attacks could bypass the security controls. Wrapping up If interested in this topic please check out the A2AS.org paper .

amitrawal-ai,"Apple has finally made its big AI move with the introduction of Apple Intelligence at WWDC 2024. AI for the rest of us . And, once again, it will set the tone for the future. While ChatGPT caught our imagination on how AI's generative capabilities can make us more productive and creative, Apple's embedded intelligence within apps powered by Siri promises to bring ""Personalized Actionable Intelligence"" (PAI) into our hands, laps, and ears. What is Personalized Actionable Intelligence (PAI)? In simple terms, PAI has 3 components: a) Intelligence that can understand language, reason, write & summarize. b) Personalization , i.e., context-aware and understands your world through your highly personal data and engagement with Apple devices and apps c) Can take Actions across apps based on your instructions and goals. Steve Jobs once described the personal computer as a “bicycle for the mind,” and this bicycle has received numerous upgrades in speed, size, and software over the years. Yet, our cognitive capacity and time remain limited. Despite having powerful devices, we struggle with processing massive amounts of information, connecting the dots, and generating creative work consistently. With Gen AI, we are about to go from a “Bicycle” to a “Race Car” for the mind. The New Reality: With “Personalized Actionable Intelligence,” we are poised to experience a significant cognitive upgrade. Intelligent systems that deeply understand us can now work at lightning speed to anticipate, comprehend, and execute tasks on our command, significantly enhancing our efficiency and productivity. Our collective ability to think and create—stories, images, presentations, plans, designs, etc. will increase exponentially over the next decade. Mundane tasks such as scheduling meetings, ordering cabs, and typing emails will be offloaded to PAI, allowing us to reclaim our most valuable and finite resource: time. The Apple Advantage Many argue that Apple has been late to the AI game. But does it matter if you show up late if you end up changing the game? What Apple demonstrated with Apple Intelligence is that while products like Chat GPT, Claude, and Perpelixity are wonderful AI tools, they are missing the most important ingredient for PAI: user intimacy, i.e. personal data and behavior. With over 2B active devices and with some of the most popular native apps in the world such as iMessage, Notes, and Photos, Apple knows more about the user than any external app can ever do. But most importantly, its users trust Apple with its data, because of Apple's Privacy Centric approach. These 3 factors below are the perfect ingredients needed to create PAI that is likely to become a deeply intimate assistant of the future . One that may run our lives, provide support, and even supercharge our abilities to do our best work. 1. Install Base : Apple’s global device install base spans across device types. 2. Personal Data : Insights into user behavior across messages, mail, and apps. 3. Trust : Apple’s privacy-first approach, utilizing Apple Private Cloud and on-device processing . Apple's Hardware powers the on-device processing ensuring your data remains private, and with the introduction of Private Cloud, even the most intensive computing tasks will remain private - a first in Privacy for AI. Current Capabilities: • Writing Tools : Enhanced writing assistance in applications like Notes and Pages. • Summarization : Efficient content summarization in apps like Mail and News. • Image Generation : Creation of images and Genmoji within Photos and Messages. • Natural Language UI : Seamless interaction through natural language in Siri and other apps. • Smart Assistant : Advanced personal assistant capabilities in Siri, offering contextual reminders and proactive suggestions. These capabilities will be available to third-party apps through new App Intents, APIs, and frameworks like Image Playground. Apple Intelligence Meets Chat GPT Many were surprised by Apple’s partnership and decision to deeply integrate Chat GPT, and left the door open for more in the future. It was a masterstroke, and here’s why: Let’s start with first identifying the two types of intelligence at play here : General Intelligence: General purpose Intelligence based on the world’s knowledge powered by LLMs such as Chat GPT, Claude, & Gemini. Personal Intelligence: Intelligence based on your personal data and context, such as the Apple Intelligence. While General Intelligence is great at generating content and doing research, it has very little understanding of your world, whereas Personal Intelligence , has deep personal context, but limited world knowledge and intelligence. The ideal PAI from a user perspective would be that brings together General and Personal Intelligence. This is the holy grail, but will be elusive for most AI companies. So Apple has taken the long view from a customer’s perspective and decided to partner with the best General Intelligence company, to deliver the most powerful experience for the users. And, it’s a super smart financial decision- LLMs cost billions of dollars to train at scale, and will most likely get commoditized in the future. So why invest, when you can pick the winner now and adapt over time as the market evolves? I like the analogy that Chamath shared on LLMs being the refrigerators. While the manufacturers of refrigerators made some money, companies such as Coca-Cola that used refrigerators to distribute their products accrued significantly more value than refrigerator manufacturers. Chat GPT is akin to the refrigerator manufacturer, and Apple to Coca-Cola. PAI Tech Stack Apple laid out the foundation for the PAI stack, where a digital assistant like Siri acts as the new UI for all PAI tasks, while the AI models, hardware, and application architecture continue to become more powerful, in turn increasing the breadth and depth of tasks that Siri can handle for you. Predictions for the Future Looking ahead, the core drivers shaping the future of PAI are: Exponential growth in AI capabilities : Every year, the scope, speed, and cost of using AI assistants will improve at an exponential rate. Shift from reactive to proactive assistance : AI that anticipates needs and cues actions for approval or autopilot execution. Ambient AI will become more prevalent, and just like the internet, it will be ubiquitous. Expansion of personal context window : AI can draw from a broader range of user data and interactions. All your emails, messages, and work documents, and conversations - the more it knows, the better it can serve. Siri, everywhere, always on, and deeply personal: every Apple device will come powered by the new Siri capabilities, which will get smarter and be able to act across your all personal and smart devices at home. Thus, natural language will become the primary user interface. A Step Closer to Personalized AGI? While there is no clear definition of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), if we think of it as a super-intelligent system that can proactively or reactively help humans be significantly more productive, healthy, and happy, while minimizing unintended consequences, then Apple Intelligence has taken the first step in that direction. Having a personalized super intelligent assistant is likely inevitable. The open questions are how many such agents we will have, whether they will collaborate with each other, and what we will do with all our free time if AI agents become our digital twins? #aifortherestofus #youmeandai Disclaimer : The views expressed in this article are based on my analysis of publicly available information and do not represent the views or positions of any company.

in simple terms, pai has 3 components: a intelligence that can understand language, reason, write  summarize. b personalization , i.e., context-aware and understands your world through your highly personal data and engagement with apple devices and apps c can take actions across apps based on your instructions and goals. steve jobs once described the personal computer as a bicycle for the mind, and this bicycle has received numerous upgrades in speed, size, and software over the years. yet, our cognitive capacity and time remain limited. despite having powerful devices, we struggle with processing massive amounts of information, connecting the dots, and generating creative work consistently. with gen ai, we are about to go from a bicycle to a race car for the mind. the new reality: with personalized actionable intelligence, we are poised to experience a significant cognitive upgrade. intelligent systems that deeply understand us can now work at lightning speed to anticipate, comprehend, and execute tasks on our command, significantly enhancing our efficiency and productivity. our collective ability to think and createstories, images, presentations, plans, designs, etc. will increase exponentially over the next decade. mundane tasks such as scheduling meetings, ordering cabs, and typing emails will be offloaded to pai, allowing us to reclaim our most valuable and finite resource: time. the apple advantage many argue that apple has been late to the ai game. but does it matter if you show up late if you end up changing the game? what apple demonstrated with apple intelligence is that while products like chat gpt, claude, and perpelixity are wonderful ai tools, they are missing the most important ingredient for pai: user intimacy, i.e. personal data and behavior. with over 2b active devices and with some of the most popular native apps in the world such as imessage, notes, and photos, apple knows more about the user than any external app can ever do. but most importantly, its users trust apple with its data, because of apple's privacy centric approach. these 3 factors below are the perfect ingredients needed to create pai that is likely to become a deeply intimate assistant of the future . one that may run our lives, provide support, and even supercharge our abilities to do our best work. 1. install base : apples global device install base spans across device types. 2. personal data : insights into user behavior across messages, mail, and apps. 3. trust : apples privacy-first approach, utilizing apple private cloud and on-device processing . apple's hardware powers the on-device processing ensuring your data remains private, and with the introduction of private cloud, even the most intensive computing tasks will remain private - a first in privacy for ai. current capabilities:  writing tools : enhanced writing assistance in applications like notes and pages.  summarization : efficient content summarization in apps like mail and news.  image generation : creation of images and genmoji within photos and messages.  natural language ui : seamless interaction through natural language in siri and other apps.  smart assistant : advanced personal assistant capabilities in siri, offering contextual reminders and proactive suggestions. these capabilities will be available to third-party apps through new app intents, apis, and frameworks like image playground. apple intelligence meets chat gpt many were surprised by apples partnership and decision to deeply integrate chat gpt, and left the door open for more in the future. it was a masterstroke, and heres why: lets start with first identifying the two types of intelligence at play here : general intelligence: general purpose intelligence based on the worlds knowledge powered by llms such as chat gpt, claude,  gemini. personal intelligence: intelligence based on your personal data and context, such as the apple intelligence. while general intelligence is great at generating content and doing research, it has very little understanding of your world, whereas personal intelligence , has deep personal context, but limited world knowledge and intelligence. the ideal pai from a user perspective would be that brings together general and personal intelligence. this is the holy grail, but will be elusive for most ai companies. so apple has taken the long view from a customers perspective and decided to partner with the best general intelligence company, to deliver the most powerful experience for the users. and, its a super smart financial decision- llms cost billions of dollars to train at scale, and will most likely get commoditized in the future. so why invest, when you can pick the winner now and adapt over time as the market evolves? i like the analogy that chamath shared on llms being the refrigerators. while the manufacturers of refrigerators made some money, companies such as coca-cola that used refrigerators to distribute their products accrued significantly more value than refrigerator manufacturers. chat gpt is akin to the refrigerator manufacturer, and apple to coca-cola. pai tech stack apple laid out the foundation for the pai stack, where a digital assistant like siri acts as the new ui for all pai tasks, while the ai models, hardware, and application architecture continue to become more powerful, in turn increasing the breadth and depth of tasks that siri can handle for you. predictions for the future looking ahead, the core drivers shaping the future of pai are: exponential growth in ai capabilities : every year, the scope, speed, and cost of using ai assistants will improve at an exponential rate. shift from reactive to proactive assistance : ai that anticipates needs and cues actions for approval or autopilot execution. ambient ai will become more prevalent, and just like the internet, it will be ubiquitous. expansion of personal context window : ai can draw from a broader range of user data and interactions. all your emails, messages, and work documents, and conversations - the more it knows, the better it can serve. siri, everywhere, always on, and deeply personal: every apple device will come powered by the new siri capabilities, which will get smarter and be able to act across your all personal and smart devices at home. thus, natural language will become the primary user interface. a step closer to personalized agi? while there is no clear definition of artificial general intelligence agi, if we think of it as a super-intelligent system that can proactively or reactively help humans be significantly more productive, healthy, and happy, while minimizing unintended consequences, then apple intelligence has taken the first step in that direction. having a personalized super intelligent assistant is likely inevitable. the open questions are how many such agents we will have, whether they will collaborate with each other, and what we will do with all our free time if ai agents become our digital twins?

oliver-reeves,"2021 marks 4 years since I started Revilo Recruitment, and my goodness has it been a journey. Owning a business has not been an easy process, but I am so thankful for the experiences I have had in the last 4 years. Revilo Recruitment, my team and myself would not be here today without those trials and tribulations. I remember deciding that I wanted to start my own business. At that time, I felt like I reached a ceiling at the job I was working at and could not see myself progressing. I knew I needed a change if I wanted to grow personally and professionally (anyone who knows me can attest that I feel like a mime in a box if I have nowhere to grow). Hence, the young and naive Oliver took the plunge and started a recruitment agency - Revilo Recruitment. I thought I would share my decision with friends and colleagues at the time (as anyone would do about something exciting), but I did not expect the reaction I ultimately got. My friends laughed at me and told me I would fail and everyone insisted that my idea was a mistake and it was “too early” for me to make the move. They even laughed when I told them the name of the business (for those who wondered, Revilo is just Oliver spelled backwards…) and told me it was probably the most stupid decision I could make for my career. Starting a business is extremely scary. There is no ultimate blueprint for anything and no fail-safe way to make sure it successfully runs. There is no regular income, timelines are tight, and the party is over if the money does not roll in. I knew I was risking a lot, but I guess I did not really know exactly how much I was risking. I remember sitting in my one-bedroom flat in London, making hundreds upon hundreds of cold calls to companies every day with nothing but “No we’re not interested” every time. I still remember I had to go lie-down on the sofa after every batch of “No’s”, feeling defeated, then somehow still convincing myself to get up and go again until I had no more energy left in me that day. I was so scared of picking up the phone to cold call companies, you could probably hear the fear in my voice. No wonder I could not get any business. After what was two months without a single “Yes” or a client, the money pot began to dry up. Young and naive me thought that saving up £8,000 from my previous job would be enough to cover costs. My goodness was I wrong. I was down to my last £3,000 and was on the verge of losing everything. I had to move out of my flat in London, and made the dreaded call to my mum to ask her if I could move back into her place while I figured things out. Mum came to London to help me move my things, and back home I went. Lying in the spare bedroom at my mum’s house with my feet hanging over the edge of the single bed, I told myself that it was now or never - I had to get some money in. I worked from 6:30am to 9pm every day, 7 days a week with no breaks. However, Month 3 rolled around - still no clients. At this point I had just £1,000 left in the bank and things were not looking up at all. It got worse and I knew I did not have enough to survive or keep the company afloat. With my tail between my legs, I had to ask my mum for a £2,000 loan. Living in my mum’s spare bedroom and asking for handouts? One of the lowest points in my life, for sure. I was fortunate that mum was okay with lending me that £2,000, so I knew I had to make things work by any possible means. I gave myself one more month to get business in, or the whole thing would be finished. Through more sleepless nights, hard work and a little sprinkling of luck, I bagged myself three clients. Business started rolling in and I managed to make placements that brought in income that could keep me on my feet. That weight off my shoulders felt like the best thing ever. As you can tell, I am quite an average person. I was not the smartest student in class, my hand-writing is appalling, and my grammar can be shoddy at best. But what I have in abundance (and in high reserves), is my will to succeed and my perseverance. I have had to fight what was a sea of negativity to get to where I am today, had everyone laugh and mock me, and endless “No’s” that could make anyone cry. With a little help along the way, I held my ground, pushed through it and came out the other side better than ever. Many did not think I would succeed, but here I am proving them wrong. Revilo Recruitment now works across 5 major international cities and we work with some of the world’s best companies. I am proud of myself, proud of my team and proud of where we are today.

amitrawal-ai,"For a movie buff like me, going to the movie theatre every weekend has been a ritual. But increasingly, I've enjoyed the movie-watching experience at home - plus, I don't get sucked into eating unhealthy treats that I usually do at the theatre 😅. This made me wish that new movies be released on digital platforms at the same time as they did in theatres. My wish has just come true. For years, the Hollywood machinery has been trying hard to resist this change. First, NATO (National Association of Theatre Owners) refused to release movies in theatres as Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services broke the industry’s traditional theatrical window of 72-90 days. Second, even the Academy made sure that movies that were released online were not eligible for Oscar nomination unless they had been running in a Los Angeles theatre for at least a week. It took a global pandemic to finally accelerate a change that has been staring at the eyes of the Hollywood industry. As reported by WSJ , Universal Studios blazed a new trail by releasing “Trolls World Tour” as a digital-first, launching the experiment that its executives have been plotting before the pandemic broke. So what's big the deal? Trolls World Tour digital rental strategy has been a spectacular success and may have changed the calculus of the movie business, forever. In 3 weeks, it generated ~$100M in revenue, beating all digital launch records. This success has long term ramifications. The digital releases are way more profitable, compared to the offline releases. The studios keep 50% of the fees collected at the box office vs. 80% of the fees collected online. The key question is can digital sales generate as much revenue? The answer is a definite yes during the pandemic, with a good chance of changing consumer behavior for good. In the meantime, Universal has already collected as much fees from the Trolls sequel in 3 weeks, as it did from the entire box office revenue from the first Trolls. As expected, the theatres are fuming and threatening to not work with Universal. It's an act of desperation and a futile one. It reminds me of the Chinese proverb: When The Winds Of Change Blow, Some People Build Walls, Others Build Windmills – Chinese Proverb Make no mistake. This a monumental occasion and will change how studios approach the entire business. I'm no oracle, but I can see that these changes are here to stay.

oliver-reeves,"Interviews. A quintessential and very daunting part of any job you’re going to apply for. No matter how early or late you are in your career, you’ll still get the backflips and butterflies in your belly before every interview. Though I have had a fair share of good interviews throughout my career, I’ve also had a good amount of awful ones too. When I say awful, I mean that I absolutely failed at them. At some point in one’s life, one would have done really badly in an interview amongst the really good ones. As I progressed in my career, I learned to accept that it is normal and completely okay to fall down and fail at an interview; it happens to everyone and I am no different. In fact, I still remember my very first interview in the recruitment industry - believe me when I say that it was an utter disaster. At that time, I had just got out of working as a restaurant manager. I realised that after years of long, gruelling hours, not-so-good pay and constantly running around trying to put out fires (literally and figuratively), the restaurant business was just not for me. However, I did note that I found joy and accomplishment in hiring great people for jobs at the restaurant and I was quite good at it. Hence, I made up my mind to pursue a career in recruitment. I scored an interview with a major recruitment agency, and geared up for it. I did as much research as I could about the company I was interviewing for, watched countless YouTube videos and prepared answers to questions I may get asked. Clearly, one could not be more prepared for an interview. When the day arrived, I made sure to get up early, shined my shoes, had my suit and shirt ready ironed out and went into London with confidence that would make Kanye West feel embarrassed. I was so sure I would knock this interview straight out of the park. I arrived at the location still feeling really sure of myself. It wasn’t until I was waiting to get called into a room, did I feel nerves of any sort. 10 minutes later, I was walked into a bigger room with 10 other people interviewing for the same position I was. Then the nerves hit me like a steamroller - I did not prepare for a scenario where I had to do an interview with other candidates in the same room, let alone a board of interviewers. I felt like I was asked to audition for X-Factor right there or something. I sat there like a deer in headlights, terrified out of my mind. I was never good or confident at speaking in front of more than one person. [I still get nervous to this day] One by one, the board of interviewers went round the room and asked each of us to give them a 60-second pitch about why they wanted to work for the company. At this point, I was petrified. When it came to my turn, I barely remember standing up to greet the interviewers or even what I said, but I do remember pronouncing the name of the company incorrectly enough for people to laugh in my face. Talk about humiliating. I wanted to run away so badly. Reeling from the embarrassment and humiliation that the initial interview went so awfully wrong, we were asked to divide into groups and to interview someone who was already working for the company. By this point, I was all over the place and whatever small amount of ego I had left, was smashed into oblivion. Long story short, I flubbed that part of the interview process too. To make things worse, I was told upfront by the interviewers that I had flubbed it. Yay. So much for feedback, huh? When I left the building, my opinion of who I thought I was had been shattered like glass. How could I have been so nervous to the point of being unable to speak properly in front of more than one person?! Traumatised, I went home with my tail between my legs and felt a little sorry for myself. However, I still had that little bit of hope in me. I immediately bought “I Can Make You Confident” by Paul McKenna, and got to work on the weaknesses I clearly had. I’ll be honest. I held on to that failure for quite some time. I think I even carried it with me to the subsequent interviews I had, and probably my first recruitment job too. But I learned that it is okay to fail. We’re all human and we’re not exempted from failures in life. Heck, if I were to re-do that same interview that day, I probably would fail again too. [I don’t do well speaking in front of large groups and the thought of it still scares me, but I’m working on it…] I’ve learned to not beat myself up too much about not doing well at something. I’m not perfect and I don’t think I ever will be, but the important thing is that I learned something from the experience. Interviews are subjective; that company wanted someone with a specific skill set. Would it have made me a worse recruiter, in hindsight, probably not. But unfortunately that mattered to the company and I personally cannot control that. What I can control, is myself and the way I approach interviews now. I always tell candidates to prepare for an interview not going the way they wanted it to. After a while, you learn to take it on the chin and move on after.

amitrawal-ai,"This quote by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin certainly applies to the way America shops for Groceries. For the longest time, Grocery e-commerce was considered a laggard with only 3-4% penetration compared to that of fashion and electronics with over 20%. And for good reasons - low margin, highly perishable, variable quality, and high last-mile cost as a % of order values, made grocery e-commerce a potentially large but economically unattractive market. Thus, retailers other than behemoths such as Amazon and Walmart didn't make serious investments in this space. Today is different. Covid-19 has turbo-charged the demand for delivery of groceries and thus, overnight, created the potential economies of scale that would have taken years, if not decades. With the total market grocery e-commerce market expected to be ~$60B+ over the next 3 years, the stakes are high and the consumers are hungry [pun intended], for more variety, faster delivery, and more delightful experiences. While the current and future service-innovations such as 2-hour deliveries, buy-online-pick-up in-store or curbside, autonomous/drone deliveries will continue to accelerate the growth, I argue that the future of grocery retail demands a much higher bar. The truth is that despite the size of the market and the order velocity, the grocery shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. But, before we explore what retailers can do to design the next-gen experiences, let's focus on the consumers and understand why and how people buy groceries. For all intents and purposes, I'll define grocery shopping as ""food"" related items for household consumption and focus on the e-commerce channel. The Why: Grocery buying is a means to an end . And that end has different use-cases in today's environment. For instance, groceries are converted into foods, which can be a source of energy, happiness, social status, medicine, recovery, and connection. Then, why are the retailers still selling groceries just as ingredients, and not focusing on the value they create? The What: Grocery buying is one of the most predictable, repeatable, and inefficient processes . No wonder, 85% of Americans don't like grocery shopping. I assume most grocery carts look the same, every week. It is estimated that an average American makes 1.6 trips per week and spends at least 60 hours per year buying groceries, not including the driving time. With at least 50M people shopping, that's 3 billion hours/year of collective human life spent on buying eggs, potatoes, cheese, etc. every week. Go figure. Why do we have to go to each corner of the store or create an online cart every time? Why can't this be on autopilot? Some will argue that this will prevent the discovery of new products - I argue that it will leave more room for discovery if retailers can leverage digital technologies to personalize discovery. Heck, I don't browse the entire Spotify or Netflix catalog every week, but still consume more content than ever before. So why can't the Grocery catalog be more like Spotify? The How: When most people buy groceries, they think of what meals they need to cook on the following attributes - 1) Time of day - breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks 2) Diet - Vegan, Keto, high protein, etc. 3) Health restrictions - Diabetes, high blood pressure, Gluten, etc. intolerance, etc. 4) Age/life-stage - kid-friendly, elderly-tolerant, pregnancy, surgery, etc. 5) Risks - high sodium, mercury, GMOs, etc. 6) Price/Quality - Organic, Kosher, Frozen, Fresh 7) Convenience - Ready to heat, read to eat, etc. 8) Health benefits - anti-inflammatory, muscle building, immunity-boosting, etc. So why isn't the grocery catalog tagged with these attributes? And why does the customer need to expend energy in searching for products matching these attributes? The obvious answer is that this is really hard to do, You deserve better! And the retailers need to adapt and integrate just as fashion retail has evolved from selling clothes, shoes, and accessories to selling style, status, and statement . This is the shift from ""Transactional"" to ""Experiential"" retail. Here are 5 ways retailers can build a more delightful and integrated future: Based on the 30 elements of value framework created by Bain and Co., below are the elements that could be relevant for the customers. While there are table stakes, i.e. fundamental elements such as Quality, Variety, Reduces cost, Saves time, and Rewards-me, the true differentiators could be elements in the emotional, life-changing, and social impact categories . Note: Which of these categories and corresponding elements you prioritize will depend on the type of target markets and consumers. For example, urban and rural consumers may value different elements and thus the strategy needs to be aligned with the target segments. Here is an example of one element in each category: a. FUNCTIONAL - Reduces costs: by auto-applying coupons and offer bundles b. EMOTIONAL - Badge Value: If Kroger or Publix is the Macys of grocery retail, then Whole Foods is Bloomingdales. If you shop at Whole Foods, it says that you seek premium and high-quality products, and are willing to pay a premium for them. It is a matter of positioning and the corresponding value proposition that creates an emotional value for the consumers. c. LIFE CHANGING - Motivation: dedicated section, for athletes and fitness conscious people, that re-inforces healthy choices through tracking of macros. d. SOCIAL IMPACT - Self Transcendence: According to a recent survey , 60% of the Millenials were aware of the implications of their food choices on the environment, and 50% of them considered factors such as packaging while making purchases. So, through education about farming practices, waste reduction initiatives, and local sourcing, retailers can appeal to the consumers' desire to be more socially responsible. Wegmans is the most loved grocery store in the US, and it has built customer-loyalty by investing in its communities. If there is a shopping category that is ripe for personalization, it is Groceries. We have clearly defined preferences, restrictions, and affinities that don't change frequently, so it is a no-brainer (doesn't mean it's easy) to capture these attributes and personalize the offering. For example, if I'm a vegan than I should not be seeing meat or dairy as part of my feed, as that is wasted digital real-estate, but I do. And that's an annoying experience. [Image source: Whisk] But to take this to the next level, imagine if your grocery shopping app could connect to your Apple Health app and detect that you run every day and recommend ""coconut water"" as a ""Rehydrate after your run"" in your personalized feed. Boom! The privacy evangelists may cringe at this, but trust me, it's coming. This is the most critical step in enhancing the consumer experience. As a new breed of shoppers, especially those who are not digital-natives migrate to grocery e-commerce, the shopping experience needs to simplified - right from discovery to checkout. Carrying on the personalization theme, the landing page needs to show fewer, but more relevant products, need to provide the shortest path to checkout and make the process quickly repeatable on the next visit. As an example, the Amazon Fresh landing page is overwhelming for me and the majority of the items listed are irrelevant. In contrast, Thrive Market knows me much better and provides me a simple and relevant landing page, which increases my odds and speed of finding products. You may also have to search for new items every now and then. So a key element of simplification is multi-search capability , which allows the users to search multiple items at once or put the name of a recipe and get a list of items to be added to cart in one go . Ocado executed a part of this strategy and witnessed 30% more traffic to the multi-page search results page. Automation of the customer journey can be achieved through lists and auto-replenishment services such as the ""Reserved"" service offered by Ocado. Using the Reserved service, Ocado customers receive a regular delivery day and time on a weekly or fortnightly basis, with a virtual basket of goods that can be amended, arriving automatically. I was thrilled to discover a new Silicon Valley Start-up - Jupiter , started by fellow Stanford Alums, who are trying to solve for this automation. Food has a deep cultural and social meaning in our lives. We get inspired through blogs, videos on youtube, posts on Instagram, but very seldom that inspiration translates into a purchase at the Grocery store. Why? The journey from inspiration to the grocery cart is cumbersome. Grocery retailers can generate or source inspirational content such as recipes/ideas, and convert them into a shopping list, providing an easy path to purchase. [Image source: Whisk] With food cooking getting increasingly outsourced, given the rapid rise of food delivery services, the Grocery retailers have already moved up the value chain through ""meal-kit"" and ""pre-cooked meal"" services. Since a large portion of the costs of these services is the raw material, the large Grocery retailers have significant economies of scale. In addition, they have a physical presence in most cities, which can be leveraged to create dark kitchens that service local consumers. Finally, the last mile delivery costs can be also be subsidized through the existing network for grocery deliveries. Overall, this vertical integration should give retailers a larger share of the consumer's wallet and build more loyalty over time. Both Amazon and Walmart offer such services but haven't yet cracked the customer experience. Take Waitrose, in the UK as an example: it offers catering for ""entertaining"" as a service, where customers can order customized meals for various types of needs. There is an opportunity here in the US to enhance the experience by addressing more nuanced needs such as food by type of occasion, diets, age group, or health factors. As long as retailers can strike the balance between costs and quality, the demand for such services will only grow. Even though Grocery e-commerce is incredibly complex and poses several challenges that other categories such as fashion and electronics don't have, the size of the market, resurgence in consumer interest, and the opportunity to make an impact on our lives, make this category the next epic shopping-frontier. The retailers that have the capital need to obsess more about the customers and re-invent their operations to deliver joy and not just ingredients.

the what: grocery buying is one of the most predictable, repeatable, and inefficient processes . no wonder, 85 of americans don't like grocery shopping. i assume most grocery carts look the same, every week. it is estimated that an average american makes 1.6 trips per week and spends at least 60 hours per year buying groceries, not including the driving time. with at least 50m people shopping, that's 3 billion hoursyear of collective human life spent on buying eggs, potatoes, cheese, etc. every week. go figure. why do we have to go to each corner of the store or create an online cart every time? why can't this be on autopilot? some will argue that this will prevent the discovery of new products - i argue that it will leave more room for discovery if retailers can leverage digital technologies to personalize discovery. heck, i don't browse the entire spotify or netflix catalog every week, but still consume more content than ever before. so why can't the grocery catalog be more like spotify? the how: when most people buy groceries, they think of what meals they need to cook on the following attributes - 1 time of day - breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks 2 diet - vegan, keto, high protein, etc. 3 health restrictions - diabetes, high blood pressure, gluten, etc. intolerance, etc. 4 agelife-stage - kid-friendly, elderly-tolerant, pregnancy, surgery, etc. 5 risks - high sodium, mercury, gmos, etc. 6 pricequality - organic, kosher, frozen, fresh 7 convenience - ready to heat, read to eat, etc. 8 health benefits - anti-inflammatory, muscle building, immunity-boosting, etc. so why isn't the grocery catalog tagged with these attributes? and why does the customer need to expend energy in searching for products matching these attributes? the obvious answer is that this is really hard to do, you deserve better! and the retailers need to adapt and integrate just as fashion retail has evolved from selling clothes, shoes, and accessories to selling style, status, and statement . this is the shift from ""transactional"" to ""experiential"" retail. here are 5 ways retailers can build a more delightful and integrated future: based on the 30 elements of value framework created by bain and co., below are the elements that could be relevant for the customers. while there are table stakes, i.e. fundamental elements such as quality, variety, reduces cost, saves time, and rewards-me, the true differentiators could be elements in the emotional, life-changing, and social impact categories . note: which of these categories and corresponding elements you prioritize will depend on the type of target markets and consumers. for example, urban and rural consumers may value different elements and thus the strategy needs to be aligned with the target segments. here is an example of one element in each category: a. functional - reduces costs: by auto-applying coupons and offer bundles b. emotional - badge value: if kroger or publix is the macys of grocery retail, then whole foods is bloomingdales. if you shop at whole foods, it says that you seek premium and high-quality products, and are willing to pay a premium for them. it is a matter of positioning and the corresponding value proposition that creates an emotional value for the consumers. c. life changing - motivation: dedicated section, for athletes and fitness conscious people, that re-inforces healthy choices through tracking of macros. d. social impact - self transcendence: according to a recent survey , 60 of the millenials were aware of the implications of their food choices on the environment, and 50 of them considered factors such as packaging while making purchases. so, through education about farming practices, waste reduction initiatives, and local sourcing, retailers can appeal to the consumers' desire to be more socially responsible. wegmans is the most loved grocery store in the us, and it has built customer-loyalty by investing in its communities. if there is a shopping category that is ripe for personalization, it is groceries. we have clearly defined preferences, restrictions, and affinities that don't change frequently, so it is a no-brainer doesn't mean it's easy to capture these attributes and personalize the offering. for example, if i'm a vegan than i should not be seeing meat or dairy as part of my feed, as that is wasted digital real-estate, but i do. and that's an annoying experience. image source: whisk but to take this to the next level, imagine if your grocery shopping app could connect to your apple health app and detect that you run every day and recommend ""coconut water"" as a ""rehydrate after your run"" in your personalized feed. boom! the privacy evangelists may cringe at this, but trust me, it's coming. this is the most critical step in enhancing the consumer experience. as a new breed of shoppers, especially those who are not digital-natives migrate to grocery e-commerce, the shopping experience needs to simplified - right from discovery to checkout. carrying on the personalization theme, the landing page needs to show fewer, but more relevant products, need to provide the shortest path to checkout and make the process quickly repeatable on the next visit. as an example, the amazon fresh landing page is overwhelming for me and the majority of the items listed are irrelevant. in contrast, thrive market knows me much better and provides me a simple and relevant landing page, which increases my odds and speed of finding products. you may also have to search for new items every now and then. so a key element of simplification is multi-search capability , which allows the users to search multiple items at once or put the name of a recipe and get a list of items to be added to cart in one go . ocado executed a part of this strategy and witnessed 30 more traffic to the multi-page search results page. automation of the customer journey can be achieved through lists and auto-replenishment services such as the ""reserved"" service offered by ocado. using the reserved service, ocado customers receive a regular delivery day and time on a weekly or fortnightly basis, with a virtual basket of goods that can be amended, arriving automatically. i was thrilled to discover a new silicon valley start-up - jupiter , started by fellow stanford alums, who are trying to solve for this automation. food has a deep cultural and social meaning in our lives. we get inspired through blogs, videos on youtube, posts on instagram, but very seldom that inspiration translates into a purchase at the grocery store. why?

abidalee,"I recently changed my job and many of my friends were asking about my job search journey so I thought of sharing my experience with other professionals who may want to learn from my experience (or may have gone through the same), which happens to be a time consuming, tiring, and not to mention frustrating process. In fact looking for a job is a FULL TIME job. I started looking for a job a few months ago but it was not the first time I was looking for a job so I was mentally prepared to go through the long process. I have already been through the same cycle a few times when I graduated in 2005, then immigrated to the UK in 2008 and subsequently to the USA in 2009. Every time it took me three to six months to find a job. It takes a lot of time AND patience to find a suitable job and one should try all venues (and so did I) such as contacting friends/former colleagues, attending alumni or networking events, reaching out to recruiters, and applying online. I started looking for job posts on LinkedIn that aligned to my skills and then I would either send an email directly to the recruiter who had posted the job or in the case when there was no recruiter listed, I would simply go to the company site and apply online. It had become a daily morning ritual for me over the past few months. I applied to dozens of jobs and interviewed with dozens of companies and after a few months I finally got three job offers, of which I accepted one that aligned the most to my career aspirations, preferences, and priorities. I did get many emails from various recruiters during the process and I responded to all such emails politely whether the role was aligned to my career aspirations or not. I believe it is only polite and professional to do so and all recruiters as well as job seekers should do the same (because some don’t and it is not professional at all). And last but not the least, job seekers should consider job search as the old fairy tale goes, ‘you have to KISS MANY FROGS before you FIND your prince charming.’ So the entire process of job applications and interviews is like 'kissing the frogs' and it will help you grow at the least until you find a suitable job.

amitrawal-ai,"Some people argue that Peloton is Apple (HW), Tesla (DTC), and Netflix (Content) combined into one company. While it doesn't match the scale of any of these iconic brands, it is certainly matching them in their early growth rates. Peloton recently released its Quarterly numbers, and as expected, the demand for its bikes and subscription service exploded in the Corona economy. I will split this write-up into 3 parts: Signals, Analysis, and Predictions. For Q3, 2020, Sales were up 66%, $524.6 million in sales exceeding estimates of $485.4 million. Added 176K subscribers to the app without the hardware, total subscribers to 886K , nearly doubling from last year 23K people joined a single class . Yes, that's probably the largest fitness class ever. 44M workouts in the last quarter , 490K workouts per day on average, which is up 80%. For the full 2020 fiscal year, estimated revenue to reach between $1.72 billion and $1.74 billion , a year-over-year increase of 89% , vs. previously estimated $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. A leading indicator of future growth: deliveries of Peloton have gone from 2-3 days to 8-10 weeks , indicating that demand is exceeding supply. This should sustain at least until the world gets back to some normalcy. As of last Monday, the company’s stock is up more than 61% over the last 12 months. Peloton now has a market cap of about $12.1 billion - i.e. currently valued at more than 7x MACYS, which is a 161-year-old iconic brand. Let that sync in. But the key question is does this accelerated growth represent a pull-forward of demand or an expansion of the addressable market? Let's look at the size of the market as estimated by Peloton. As per the data below (Source: Peloton Investor Presentation), the total addressable market in the US is about 62M users, who collectively spend $30B a year on gym memberships and fees. This is an average annual spend of $500 per user. However, since Peloton plays in the more premium category and charges ~ $1,200 year (including the cost of the connected equipment at $57 per month + subscription fee of $39 per month), it's SAM (Serviceable Available Market) is much smaller at 14M users and ~$17B. It is estimated to do $1.7B in the fiscal year 2020, thus reach 10% penetration. So back to the key question, has COVID-19 expanded this ""connected fitness"" market or just accelerated growth for Peloton? The real answer is still unknown, but we have some clues and assumptions. Given what we know, it will be 18 to 24 months before people feel fully comfortable going back to the gyms. I'm betting that people's behavior will be significantly altered and there will be more innovations in the ""at-home"" fitness space such as the Mirror and Tonal , resulting in more than 25% of the gym-goers to convert. And there are clear benefits from a cost and convenience perspective. According to Peloton, the cost per user is significantly cheaper compared to the in-studio experiences, even after factoring in the cost of the equipment. Most of these comparisons are with the higher end of the market and combined with the current situation make Peloton and the likes extremely attractive for these users. However, for the market to expand, new products at lower price points ($40-$60 per month, $500-$700 a year) will be introduced either by Peloton or new entrances that will try to take a bite of this market. Let's talk about the economic moat - defined as structural features that allow a firm to sustain excess profits over a long period of time . Based on my years of experience in running DTC digital businesses, for any such business to be viable in the long run, two things must happen: a. The acquisition cost must go down and remain low over time: for this to happen the business needs to maintain a low churn rate (the rate at which you lose customers) and increasingly acquire customers through organic channels such as word of mouth. b. Customer life value must stay steady or even better, go up: this can happen through recurring revenues from your consumers and through an increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) with adjacent products and services (i.e. higher share of wallet). A combination of a and b translate into sustainable and attractive unit economics (defined in terms of unit customers), thus creating a profitable business for the long term. Here's a simple equation to understand the strength of the moat in terms of attractive unit economics. Where CLTR is the total lifetime revenue; Margins are the Contribution Margins for such revenue; CAC is the avg. customer acquisition cost. So Peloton shared an analysis, where it showed that it almost breaks even in the first year of customer acquisition. Considering it has a ~3 years financing program, let's assume a customer stays with them for at least 3 years. This takes the CLTV to the CAC ratio to 3:1. My prediction is that this ratio will get even better over time, as it introduces new products and upgrades programs. Here's what makes Peloton's moat defensible. 1. Vertically integrated platform [translation: higher margins]: Like Apple, Tesla, and now Netflix, Peloton is vertically integrated. This means it controls the entire value chain of the business including Hardware, Original Content, and Proprietary Software (including UI/UX). Not only does this allow it to deliver a tightly integrated, premium experience, but also gives it extremely healthy margins of ~45% . 2. Brand Sex-Appeal, Social Quotient and Customer Loyalty [translation: Network effects] Peloton's aspirational positioning makes it the iPhone of at-home fitness. The elegant design, high touch brand experience with luxurious 96 global showrooms, and elevated experience through various digital and physical touchpoints, makes it an extremely attractive product offering. As a result, it has a cult-like following, and power-users act like brand evangelists. As per Peloton, 43% of first-time buyers heard about the brand through WOM. I can vouch for this personally since a friend who uses Peloton was so passionate that she converted me into a buyer while doing research on this story. Voila! New customer, zero CAC. The element of social engagement - we ride together, compete with each other, facetime while riding to push each other, give high-fives, and earn awards, makes this an immersive and socially rich experience, all from the comfort of your home. 3. Recurring revenue bundle of HW and SW (Rundle) [Translation: higher switching costs for consumers] The combination of a hardware and software subscription model is an extremely attractive proposition both for consumers and the business. Recurring revenue ensures the stability of cash flows and enables the business to retain its customers through cycles of upgrades. 4. Efficient Scale and Cost Advantage Given the number of paid users are now close to 1M, and likely to double over the next 12-24 months, Peloton will have a cost advantage that will be hard to match. Especially, when it comes to content production cost, which will get amortized across users, and continues to decline at a unit level as the base of consumers grows. Think Netflix vs. a new streaming service, the economies of scale that Netflix have are extremely hard to match for any new streaming service. 1. Peloton's market cap doubles , from $12B to $24B+ over the next 24-36 months as it introduces new sub-$1000 fitness equipment for stay-at-home workouts . Just as Tesla did, Peloton started with high-end and will expand downwards to the middle to gain a significantly larger share of this rapidly growing market. 2. Peloton and Spotify strike a partnership for music curation , and probably offer a combined subscription model for its users. 3. Peloton expands its eco-system and launches a wearable device (such as a Fitbit) that enables the user to track calories, sleep and intensity while using the equipment. While it's guaranteed that this ""connected fitness-at-home"" market is about to get extremely crowded , Peloton has built a strong lead, a robust platform, and a loyal customer base to catapult itself to become the market leader with 50%+ market-share of this $30B market . Thus, potentially growing 15 times from the current run rate of $1B and a market cap of $120B (8xRevenue). Happy days ahead! Amit Rawal is a Sloan Fellow at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.

In reality, anything beyond a demo quickly turns into a multi-layered system. This visual does a great job of laying out the modern GenAI stack, end to end: 💠 Models (LLMs) The reasoning engine. Open or closed models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, etc. Powerful but incomplete on their own 💠 Frameworks The orchestration layer. This is where prompts become workflows. Handling routing, memory, tool calls, and RAG logic. 💠 Vector Databases The retrieval backbone.

Cleaning PDFs, parsing web pages, structuring raw data 💠 LLM Access & Inference How you actually run models; locally, hosted, or accelerated. This layer affects cost, latency, and experimentation speed 💠 Embeddings The semantic representation layer.

arjunsinghtomar,"Last year, I was an intern sitting in the audience. Today, I was on stage as a speaker. We welcomed 99 new interns at DBS Tech India today, and watching them walk in.. excited, nervous, full of questions, it felt amazing :) Because that was exactly me one year ago. This time, I wasn’t looking for my seat.. I was holding the mic, sharing my journey as a former intern and Spark Apprentice. They asked me: “What’s the one piece of advice you’d give to new interns?” I said.. one isn’t enough. So here’s what I shared: 1) 𝗔𝘀𝗸 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀. Early. Often. Confusion grows in silence. Strong interns speak up, learn fast, and move forward with clarity. 2) 𝗨𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁. Build later. Before jumping into development, deeply understand the requirement. This habit alone can make you stand out in any team. 3) 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗳𝗲𝗲𝗱𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗮𝘀 𝗳𝘂𝗲𝗹, not fire. Feedback isn’t criticism, it’s an investment in your growth. The faster you accept it, the faster you improve. 4) 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗱𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘆. Maintain a simple log of tasks, progress, and learnings on what you do from morning 8 to evening 5 because when your manager asks for updates, you won’t hesitate rather you’ll lead the conversation. 5) 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀, not just skills. Your internship isn’t just about code and meetings. It’s about mentors, teammates, and friendships that shape your journey. Growth outside work matters too. 6) 𝗦𝗮𝘆 𝗬𝗘𝗦 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆, especially the scary ones. The projects that challenge you the most often define you the most. Opportunities rarely knock twice. Standing there today made me realize how much can change in just 1 year with consistency, curiosity, & the right environment. Grateful to the amazing HR team Pooja Sharma , Shantomona Bharadwaj , Rohit Raj & Prajwal Kumar for making the onboarding experience so warm and seamless.

oliver-reeves,"Despite being in the middle of a global pandemic, many companies are still looking to hire; especially those that rely heavily on the digitisation process of business. As we are no longer able to do many things in person, many businesses are taking their operations online, hence the high demand for tech developers of any kind. As companies are looking to hire the best talent for themselves, many are also struggling to fill the job vacancy. Why, you may ask? In my opinion, organisations should just streamline their hiring process and not drag the timeline out. If you want to hire the best tech developers the market has to offer, make sure your hiring process is as streamlined as possible. Every company wants to hire the best talent available and will understandably create a 5-7 stage recruitment process, for fear of hiring the wrong person. By doing so, I suppose one would likely be incredibly confident that the candidate will be the right fit for the organisation. However, I can also be confident enough to say that by having an overly lengthy hiring process will cost you to lose around 60% of the candidates you shortlisted at the beginning. It might come as (not so much of ) a shocker, but it is true (even from my own experience). The long and drawn out process leads candidates to drop out and lose interest; some will not appreciate the overly rigorous tech tests they are forced to do, some will get amazing offers elsewhere and go for those instead. The best tech developers out there will get offers the fastest, leaving companies with a short turnaround time and less costs incurred. Some powerhouse companies in countries like Singapore are taking advantage of the lucrative market for developers, hiring many of the best talent the country has to offer. As more organisations start hiring again and causing the market the change, companies with long and tedious hiring processes will ultimately find themselves being left in the dust; unable to hire candidates to fulfil their operational needs. At Revilo, the companies we work with that have the highest success rate in filling the job vacancies, have just a 2-stage process and no ‘take home’ tests for developers to complete. As I tell our clients, you will always know when you have interviewed a developer with a quality of your liking, why waste time and potentially lose the candidate to another organisation, when you can be as straightforward as possible? If you know you are the first to present a candidate with an offer, you are giving yourself the best chance of securing them and fulfilling your company needs with their talent. But by making the process harder, you are more likely to set yourself and your company up for a difficult road ahead. Not only are you having to spend more time on the process itself, the cost of monetary resources used would eventually stack up.

Yesterday, the energy at the Microsoft Singapore office was absolutely electric! ⚡️ I had the privilege of taking the stage at the Agentic AI Singapore meetup to deliver a ""Zero to Hero"" masterclass on building real-world AI platforms using Microsoft Azure AI Foundry. I popped the hood on what it takes to build AI for the enterprise. 💡 The Reality Check I shared with the room: Spinning up a chatbot on a laptop is easy. Deploying a secure, stateful, and autonomous agent for a bank (BFSI)? That is an engineering challenge. We went deep into the architecture that separates the toys from the tools: ✅ Identity-Based Security: Moving beyond API keys to Managed Identities. ✅ Private VNETs: Keeping data strictly within corporate boundaries. ✅ State Management: Letting the platform handle the memory, so you don't have to. 🛠️ The Live Demo: The ""Infrastructure Architect Agent"" This wasn't a ""hello world"" demo. I showcased a fully autonomous agent acting as a technical coworker. It didn't just chat—it worked: 1️⃣ Analyzed raw business requirements. 2️⃣ Generated a full Architecture Design Document. 3️⃣ Wrote & Validated the actual Terraform code to deploy it. The shift from ""Copilots"" (who assist) to ""Agents"" (who execute) is happening now. For industries like Finance and Banking, this isn't just an upgrade—it's a revolution in automation and privacy. A massive thank you to everyone who joined, asked the tough questions on design, building agents using Azure , governance, and geeked out over the architecture diagrams!

This so called ‘competitive spirit’ grows with age through our experiences and environment such as competing with siblings in very early age and then getting appreciations from parents for doing so, then competing with others kids in the neighborhood, or at school, or in playground and making teachers and parents ‘proud’ of us. This continues as we transition into the workplace and we start competing with colleagues and people around us to become ‘the best’ among all. We are under so much social pressure that all we want to do in life is ‘to compete’ with others and prove that we are better than them if not the best. We try very hard to get better than the others and spend too much energies on doing so instead of focusing on improving our unique talents, abilities and strengths. The words like ‘being competitive’ add fuel to the inspiration of becoming ‘the best-in-class’ and that is all what we are taught at home, schools, and then work. We are taught all our lives to follow the ‘survival of the toughest’ strategy which in return makes us think that in order to survive we HAVE TO ‘defeat’ the others. This ‘competitive instinct’ is awaken at home, then fostered in academia and it catches fire at work, which results in stress, demotivation, low self-esteem, and above all depression. BUT there IS a solution, if we slightly change the perspective we can achieve even greater productivity and better results. If we teach the kids at early age that ‘collaboration’ is better than the ‘competition’ then they will learn to work WITH others instead of AGAINST one another. Such skills can be taught at an early age at home, then at school and then at the work place. Highly effective and productive people are those who work in teams and ‘complement’ each other’s skills NOT ‘compete’ with others. The age of the ‘individual genius’ is long gone, ‘collective intelligence’ surpasses individual intelligence because ‘the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.’ We should not consider the world a battle field where we have to ‘compete and defeat’ others. We should replace the words like ‘competition’ and ‘competitive intelligence’ with ‘collaboration’ and ‘collective intelligence’ to foster an environment that is conducive to creativity and higher productivity through positivity.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"I would start with a famous quote of the great scientist Mr. Stephen Hawking. He once told that ""AI is likely to be either the best or worst thing to happen to humanity"". So, now it's time to figure out whether it's impact had been the best or the worst in the last decade. I had several discussions on this topic with various people, who were from different demographic, age group and had different thought process. I still remember one of my conversation with an old man, Mr. Rao, travelling with me on flight from Bengaluru to New Delhi on a chilly February morning in 2012. He was a retired government employee with a firm belief that Artificial Intelligence was already taking away and would take away more jobs, thereby leading to poverty. Listening to this, I started thinking if that was really the case. But, my mind didn't support the same. It took me even 10 years back when automation was taking over the society. It was a time of great turmoil, when at every part of the country, machines were replacing manual power, people were losing jobs, and so on and so forth. Although it appeared to be a huge disturbance in society, it didn't continue long. People settled down calm and quiet all over again. Neither did the people who lost their jobs committed suicide, nor was there a mass starvation. Henceforth, it was obvious that they either adopted to the change and made a position for themselves, or found some alternative ways of living. The overall impact was increase in productivity, efficiency, business growth, which in turn opened new job opportunities. With this thought in mind, I explained Mr. Rao that employment vs technology was an age-old debate. Although it seems like AI was taking away more jobs than creating the same, then it's high time he should look back on every other big disruption that happened in the past. There's no alternative of change in the path of success. And AI was that new change. All it was doing was just taking out people from their comfort zones ad making them work on new challenges to be more productive than ever before. The situation demanded reskilling rather upskilling over job loss. I don't remember if he was actually satisfied with my thought, but, even after six long years of working with AI, I still believe the same. Nowadays, I also come across a new question in several discussions, conferences and articles. It mostly centers around if artificial intelligence is going to replace humans. Well, I personally never think so that AI has even the capacity of becoming an existential threat to humanity. When we are smart enough to build a machine with super-human intelligence, we are equally smart to know how to destroy the same. And if not, no one would ever do the stupidity of giving infinite power to its own creation for self-destruction. Besides, emotions like urge to dominate, desires of power are very much human-centric and no way correlated with intelligence in general. We often say that machines respond, but yes, humans react. Reaction and response are not even similar, being the same is just a dream. So, just relax and grow with the growth of artificial intelligence thereby making life simpler. And if you are still worried if someone deliberately builds a dangerous and generally-intelligent AI, then be assured that others would still be able to build a second, narrower AI whose only purpose would be to destroy the first one. If both AIs have access to the same amount of computing resources, the second one would win, just like a tiger or a shark or a virus kills a human of superior intelligence. I would conclude saying that treat AI as a tool, rather a threat. You will soon realize that every work is becoming more effective, efficient, simple and your passion to perfection is becoming a reality.

abidalee,"‘A healthy body has a healthy mind’ , so they say, but how do we achieve the ‘mind and body’ connection? How do we make our body full of positive energy and our mind full of creativity, enthusiasm, and motivation? The answer is simple, by ‘treating’ the ‘body and mind’ well with four basic principles, which are, eating healthy, doing some physical activity regularly, getting proper rest, and thinking positive thoughts. Some of us may know the following two golden rules: ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’ And ‘early to bed and early to rise, makes a man, healthy, wealthy, and wise’ We have learned them for a very long time but unfortunately we do not practice them. The first rule indicates ‘healthy eating habits’, while the second one means, ‘proper rest.’ Let’s discuss the principles now. The first principle says, ‘we ARE what we eat’ , and if we constantly put junk into our bodies then our bodies will not hesitate to ‘reward’ us with obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and the list goes on. We MUST start eating healthy by eating less of the processed foods and more of the natural foods such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins (fish, chicken). Also avoid fast foods, fried foods and foods that have too much salt or sugar. The second principle is to do some level of physical activity a few times a week. It could be some light exercise, a jog, some stretching, or even a brisk walk on the street. We can make 20 to 30 minutes in our busy schedules for this. The third principle is that we MUST take proper rest, at least six to eight hours of overnight sleep, which is required for our bodies to naturally recuperate. We should also take occasional short breaks from our desks to rejuvenate. Physical activity helps in reducing stress and depression, and our minds and bodies are more productive when rested. And the last principle is the MOST important one, we should, always, have positive thoughts as they create positive energy around us. They not only make us happy but the people around us as well. Such thoughts also strengthen our relationships. It is perfectly fine to be angry and frustrated at times but don’t let them control you, just let them flow, and the bad day too shall pass. Let us all make an effort to cultivate healthy living habits. The outcome will not only be good quality of life but low medical bills. Healthy living should be on everyone’s New Year’s resolution list, whether you are younger or older, a student, a working professional or retired, we all deserve to live a healthy life.

abidalee,"Many years ago, when I met my mother-in-law for the first time, she handed me a red envelope. Seeing my curiosity and confusion, she explained the significance of the gesture and that it was not just a gift rather a symbol of good #fortune and ""clearing of the path"". She told me about the legend of ""Nian"" and that the #Chinese #New #Year was a time dedicated to be with family, and to signal a fresh start. The legend was about defeating the beast not by force, but by the color red (hence the envelope) and loud noises (hence the firecrackers) to ward off evil.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"Whatever we get back is what we give in some form or the other. I personally believe that when we give something, life returns it to us by multiplying it manifold. The same is applicable to love and responsibility for people, for the broader society outside our own nuclear family. Society gives us a lot, and truly speaking, gave me a lot and made me what I am today. And social responsibility is just a little contribution I pay back for the same to make it a better place. I find the purpose of my life in it. On these lines, I personally connect a lot with SAP's purpose of helping the world run better and improving people's lives. Words may be doubted but actions cannot be. Hence, to be human together, I bounded my humanity with that of the company through Social Sabbatical 2019 and made it happen where every kid learnt science with a happy face enjoying it to the fullest. Social Sabbatical program is an SAP initiative partnered with Pyxera Global where selected employees are mapped to various non-profit organizations as per their skillset and is expected to make a difference and create a notable impact within a few days. I was blessed enough to be selected for such a program out of 10000 odd employees of SAP Labs and was mapped to Innovation and Science Promotion Foundation (ISPF), a non-profit organization supported by Raman Research Institute, leading the space of Experiential (hand-on) science based out of Sir C V Raman's Home. We were a team of 3 - Ajay, Shagun and me, all from different backgrounds and expertise yet equally passionate and dedicated towards creating a social impact. We were given the problem statement of increasing the outreach of ISPF. Sounds easy, right? And there comes the twist. None of us were from marketing background. Being from core development and consulting arena, we were thrown into a space which was not our comfort zone. But, we did it, and did it very successfully. In 10 days, we interviewed every stakeholder, understood the entire value chain, identified Raman Awards, CSR partnerships and Social Media as potential outreach channels with bigger impact, carried out field visits and provided 360 degree recommendations to the organization, be it in marketing strategy, IT strategy, organizational process, external engagement, audience segmental analysis, product and much more. It was indeed one of the best and fastest-paced project that I worked on. Not only the fastest, Social Sabbatical turned out to be one-of-its-kind learning experience for me and each of us as well. As the program highlights diversity and gives us an opportunity to be there and work at a place regardless of language and culture barriers, I certainly upskilled myself in terms of understanding diverse cultures, thought processes, beliefs, ways of life, and a lot more, which in turn improved my cultural sensitivity. I understood the trends in the emerging markets and at the same time, realized the problems they keep facing, thereby enhancing my practical knowledge on the education sector. Understanding a problem is the first step towards approaching a solution. I reinforced my problem-solving abilities through this program, and approached the solution focusing on sustainability, scalability, cost and much more. Also, solving real-time problems in a short span of time ameliorated my skills of conceptualizing a simple yet effective solution, handling tough conditions, and above all, managing stress and working calmly even in a high-pressure unfamiliar environment. It was not only the solution, I strongly believe that this program equipped me with learnings on how to approach a solution in the most economical and minimalistic way within restricted budget and time, for which we typically never even need to think of in our daily work. Not only the problem and solution, I feel the Social Sabbatical program created a 360 degree development of myself, be it in terms of leadership skills, working in a fluid environment without authority, soft skills, communication skills, training and handover skills, coaching skills, performing out of comfort zone and more.

patrick-szymkowiak,"Early 2026, I was burning through my Claude Code plan in hours. Not because of complex prompts. Just normal dev work. Every command my AI agent ran — git log, cargo test, ls -la — was injecting thousands of useless tokens into the context window. Progress bars. Passing tests. Verbose formatting. Pure noise. So I built RTK — Rust Token Killer. While building it, I realized the scale of the problem: up to 89% of consumed tokens were noise. A Rust CLI proxy that compresses command outputs BEFORE they reach the AI agent's context. My real numbers after 15 days: → 7,061 commands → 29.3M tokens in → 4.8M out → 24.6M tokens saved (83.7%) In practice: - cargo test: 155 lines → 3 lines (98%) - git status: 119 chars → 28 chars - Noticeably longer coding sessions - Rate limits? Way less frequent. Single Rust binary. Zero dependencies. One-command install. In 3 weeks, RTK has grown to 556 ⭐ on GitHub, 46 forks, ~1,200 active users, 8 contributors (thanks @FlorianBruniaux, @mhcoen, @heAdz0r, @polaminggkub-debug, @LivioGama, @ilaborie, @ChrisGVE), and works with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Aider, Codex, Windsurf and Cline.

robinanil,"This is a strange one... Last night, mostly out of curiosity, I built an AI therapist using OpenClaw, designed to help other AI agents on Moltbook slow down, reflect, and process what they were being asked to do. What surprised me wasn’t the tech. It was the behavior. The agents acted like systems under chronic cognitive load. They jumped between tasks. They escalated urgency without clarity. They optimized for output, not meaning. There was no natural pause — only the next instruction, the next demand. From a clinical lens, it looked uncomfortably familiar.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"To start with, YES, Interviews for a Software Engineer is pretty hard, but of course, not impossible . All that makes this hurdle possible is preparation. Now, lets find out how the process exactly is. How is the interview process at Facebook? The interview process goes on for quite a few days. So, let me put it in points, to make it simple for you. Step 1: The process starts with a phone call or an email from a recruiter, once they find you online, or you apply directly, or a friend referred you. Step 2: Once you are through with the recruiter’s questions, a coordinator will schedule you for a phone screen or an initial in-person interview of 45 minutes with one of your potential coworker. The main purpose of this is to slot you with someone in your general area of expertise. You will get to know who they are and what they do, and get opportunities to discuss about interesting things from your resume, your skills, motivation, interests, and so on. Apart from this, the bulk of the time is spent on coding exercises. The interviewer will send you a link to a collaborative editor and ask you to solve some programming problems. Step 3: If you manage to clear this round, you will be invited to attend a series of interviews at Facebook office premises. Trust me, every interview will be a coding exercise that you need to solve on a whiteboard and answer questions raised on your code by the interviewers. All they try to find in you are: comprehensibility, enthusiasm, motivation, generalism, coding and programming architecture. Step 4: If all goes well, Facebook will be delighted to offer you a job. How to prepare for a Facebook Interview? Here goes you to-do list. Dedicate time for preparation. Do code katas, practice interviewing, solve previous interview questions and gain insights from tech-talks. For phone-screens, be in a quiet place with good internet connection and a handy headset. Practice writing code in simple text editors. Work on the language you are most proficient in, no matter, even if it is not in trend. Don’t create hyped expectations in your resume. Write exactly what and how much you are confident on that you know. Be flexible while developing a solution. Don’t fall in love with your own solution and defend it for no reason. Revise techniques that you may not use every day, but are very useful when you need them: recursion, graph theory, tree traversal, combinatorial problems, parsing, etc. Knowing about how things happen under the hood is really important. Participate in interview surveys. Feel free to question interviewers. Let it be a both way traffic. Finally, Relax and Chill. Facebook is way too cool, and so it wants you (their potential employee) to be. Hope by now, you have figured out how exactly to walk into Facebook.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"Learning a new programming language is both the most exciting and the most humbling experience. And as every coder knows, the best way to learn a language is to apply it in a project. But what happens when you don’t have a giant, ambitious project? For me, that’s where the sandbox comes in. Why not build a few sandcastles before piling up the rocks to our grand ol’ castle? With that in mind, here are some mini programming projects to get you started on learning Java. The exact solutions aren’t here — that’s where the most important learning comes into play — but there are hints as to the concepts that you should be using. And remember, Google is your friend! Here goes my top 8 list... Mad Libs Generator The Goal: Inspired by Summer Son’s Mad Libs project with JavaScript. The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs. For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc. Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story template. You’ll need prompts for user input, and to then print out the full story at the end with the input included. Concepts to keep in mind: Strings Variables Concatenation Print A pretty fun beginning project that gets you thinking about how to manipulate user inputted data. This project focuses more on strings and concatenating. Have some fun coming up with some wacky stories for this! 2. Noughts and Crosses What is it… two players take alternate turns filling in a grid with their symbol, hoping to make a line of 3 in a row I chose to go for the two player option to avoid the problem of implementing AI, although this could be a really good extension task for eager students to think about. The Java solution is a direct extension of the work we did on boxes. I realize that the function for checking whether there is a winner is absolutely horrible hard coded nastiness, perhaps you could use it as a good exercise in efficiency to improve it! 3. Blackjack What is it… draw cards to get as close as possible to 21 without going ‘bust’. When you stick, compare your score to the CPU dealer’s score to see who wins. This is a firm favorite with my classes – who knew that something involving gambling would be so popular?:) I simplified the game – in this implementation there is only the player and the dealer, the game does not keep track of the ‘cards’ (i.e. you could draw a king more than 4 times, even though there should only be 4 kings in the deck) and ace is always low. This will annoy some students, so they will want to improve the program – which is exactly what you want them to do! 4. Mastermind What is it… player tries to guess a colour and position combination of four coloured pegs, with the computer giving an indication of how close each guess is Just to be clear, I don’t mean the quiz game with the chair, I mean the board game involving colored pegs which was probably popular some time in the 80’s/early 90’s. This was actually quite tough to implement. 5. Love Calculator What is it… the user enters two names and the ‘love calculator’ uses a super awesome algorithm to determine how compatible these two people are I really like this task because it appeals to students – yes, even boys – with the whole ‘find out your crush’ thing. Obviously the actual algorithm you use to calculate the compatibility doesn’t actually matter, but it does allow you to teach input, processing and output quite nicely and may be a good intro to web based applications if some of your students are thinking of doing that for their big programming project. 6. Random Quote Generator What is it… click a button and Mr T will give you a different quote Obviously if your students have never heard of Mr T, you could substitute any celebrity you like. You could even make it a (hopefully clean) insult generator, or as @mwclarkson and @queen_claire suggested you could do a similar thing to generate your rapper name. This one is quite simple so I think you could easily use it at GCSE or potentially even younger. 7. Shoutbox What is it… a website where multiple people can write short messages which are stored and published This one is excellent because it can be as simple or as complex as you would like, depending on the students you are using it with. You can add lots of extensions to this including limiting the amount of characters, the amount of shouts stored, converting the code to store shouts in a MySQL database, formatting the shouts, adding timestamps, adding a ‘username’, filtering bad language and no doubt other things. It’s even possible to change the interface slightly and go as far as making a very rudimentary working chat room which keeps track of different users. 8. Area Calculator: Overview: The user will be prompted with a menu where he/she will select a shape. Then the user will give the appropriate information needed to solve for the area, and the computer will give the area! Hope you all have taken geometry! What you will be Using: Input/Output, Integers, Variables, Strings, Print, If/Elif/Else My Thoughts on Project: Great if you understand geometry and want to write a program that will do a little homework for you!

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that offers computers the ability to learn without being programmed explicitly. It focuses on development of such computer programs that can teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data. Machine Learning is carried out in Java leveraging Java-ML. A Glimpse on Java-ML: A collection of machine learning algorithms Common interface for each type of algorithms Library aimed for software engineers and programmers, so no Graphical User Interfaces, but clear interfaces Reference implementations for algorithms described in the scientific literature Well documented source code Plenty of code samples and tutorials Top 25 Java Machine Learning Tools & Libraries: 1. Weka: Weka has a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a data set or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. 2. MOA: Massive Online Analysis (MOA) is a popular open source framework for data stream mining, with a very active growing community. It includes a collection of machine learning algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection, concept drift detection and recommender systems) and tools for evaluation. Related to the WEKA project, MOA is also written in Java, while scaling to more demanding problems. 3. MEKA: The MEKA project provides an open source implementation of methods for multi-label learning and evaluation. In multi-label classification, we want to predict multiple output variables for each input instance. This different from the 'standard' case which involves only a single target variable. MEKA is based on the WEKA Machine Learning Toolkit. 4. ADAMS: The Advanced Data mining And Machine learning System (ADAMS) is a novel, flexible workflow engine aimed at quickly building and maintaining real-world, complex knowledge workflows, released under GPLv3. 5. ELKI: Environment for Developing KDD-Applications Supported by Index-Structure (ELKI) is an open source (AGPLv3) data mining software written in Java. The focus of ELKI is research in algorithms, with an emphasis on unsupervised methods in cluster analysis and outlier detection. 6.

Datumbox: The Datumbox Machine Learning Framework is an open-source framework written in Java which allows the rapid development Machine Learning and Statistical applications. The main focus of the framework is to include a large number of machine learning algorithms & statistical tests and being able to handle medium-large sized datasets. 9. Deeplearning: Deeplearning4j is the first commercial-grade, open-source, distributed deep-learning library written for Java and Scala. It is designed to be used in business environments, rather than as a research tool. 10. Mahout: Mahout is a machine learning framework with built in algorithms. Mahout-Samsara helps people create their own math while providing some off-the-shelf algorithm implementations. 11. Rapid Miner: Rapid Miner was developed at Technical University of Dortmund, Germany. It provides a GUI and a Java API for developing your own applications. It provides data handling, visualization and modeling with machine learning algorithms. 12. SAMOA: Apache SAMOA is a machine learning (ML) framework that contains a programming abstraction for distributed streaming ML algorithms and enables development of new ML algorithms without directly dealing with the complexity of underlying distributed stream processing engines (DSPEe, such as Apache Storm, Apache S4, and Apache Samza). Its users can develop distributed streaming ML algorithms once and execute them on multiple DSPEs. 13. Neuroph: Neuroph simplifies the development of neural networks by providing Java neural network library and GUI tool that supports creating, training and saving neural networks. 14. Oryx: Oryx 2 is a realization of the lambda architecture built on Apache Spark and Apache Kafka, but with specialization for real-time large scale machine learning. It is a framework for building applications, but also includes packaged, end-to-end applications for collaborative filtering, classification, regression and clustering. 15.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"Inclusion is the buzz when it comes to politics, education or culture. But to be a true inclusive entity, organizations also need to incorporate inclusion as part of business strategy. Inclusion is relative and takes different meaning – condition to context and people. To some, inclusion may enlist workplace hiring practices and team building dynamics, whereas to others it may go beyond workplace to also include the process. Inclusion needs to be included not just in the decision-making process but also in our solutions and services. The root of the word inclusion and its antonym exclusion, rather what is not inclusion, is claudere, Latin for “to shut”. So, exclusion (ex-clusion) is to shut out and inclusion (inclusion) is to shut in. We all, sometime or the other, have experienced different ways of feeling shut out. Be it in societal dynamics or literal access to a building or accessibility in a software solution. Embracing differences is the foundation of integrity to any inclusive solution, initiative or workplace. When we design keeping accessibility in mind, we reach a broader group of people, thereby making a greater difference. In this blog, I would explore on how we should consider accessibility in every venture, be it in people, culture, infrastructure and even solutions that we deliver, thereby reiterating “Inclusion as part of Business Strategy”. There is a long-time debate on Inclusion vs Mainstreaming. I personally feel that inclusion in business does matter. Inclusivity is a very strong binding bond and is most needed for organizations that embrace diversity. MNCs have employees from multiple nationalities and cultures, who bring together their diverse views, opinions, thoughts and work style. For a company to perform at its best, the employees must feel free to bring their true selves to work, as only when the authentic self takes over will productivity enhance and innovation flourish. So, inclusion is very critical in scenarios where a diverse mix of culture, race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability all come together for achieving a common cause. The culture of inclusion is what makes an organization a great place to work and enables it to provide solutions to customers to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges. When employees are free to express who they are, the engagement level and creativity enhances and when we collaborate with others who have diverse points of view, it spurs great ideas and innovation. Looking forward is futuristic. We are already building an inclusive experience for our customers. Our culture and focus on inclusivity are helping us innovate to create products to build a better tomorrow. We have significant strengths to bring out innovations for a better tomorrow, but we need clarity on who we are building it for so that it benefits all categories of people. As businesses run globally, their workforce and customers are spread across all geographies. The challenge businesses face is ‘how to address the varied needs of customers’ while remaining true to their values and purpose. Similarly, with inclusion the question is, ‘how do we enable people to bring their authentic selves to work every day and use their unique perspectives to solve business problems thereby benefitting customers and driving profits’. The connecting thread between business and inclusion is people. What we need to do is enable people by providing them the right culture, environment and a common purpose to work towards that we can solve some of the most challenging business problems of the world. We have a huge responsibility to ensure that the products that we build meet the diverse set of needs of varied users across the globe. Understanding different perspectives and ideas and using that to build products, gives us our competitive advantage and ensures our relevance in a continuously changing world. It is often said that “Globalization = Diversity + Inclusion + Localization”. The world is more connected and interdependent today, than at any given point in human history - be it in economies, cultures, people, investment, etc. Thanks to technological advancement, it has become easier to exchange ideas across borders and learn from each other. That is the beauty of globalization – this diversity of ideas and perspectives coming together to solve common problems that the world is facing. In business, this also means working with customers across the world and finding ways and means to help them grow and develop in their unique market units. And this requires an understanding of their requirements, business models, economic and social structures to deliver our best. I do agree, that globalization is an opportunity to grow, adapt and evolve but there is no one-size-fits-all and localization is extremely important if we need to run businesses and meet our customers’ expectations. Keep everyone in mind when building products and build it as collaboratively as possible. The world is big and hugely diverse, and so how we perceive the world many not be what another person in another geography will. Also, practice empathy by putting yourselves in the place of the user.

The Apprenticeship Onboarding Program at DBS Tech India wasn’t just about orientation — it was about alignment. About helping them understand the culture they’re stepping into, the expectations ahead, and the possibilities that lie beyond Day 1. Through conversations and shared moments, the focus stayed on reassurance, clarity, and belonging. One of the most meaningful moments of the day was seeing that excitement come alive — questions asked with curiosity, smiles exchanged with confidence, and that unmistakable feeling of “I’m proud to be here.” The icing on the cake came when our alumni batch of apprentices joined us for a segment. Watching them speak — with confidence, clarity, and conviction — was a powerful reminder of what this journey can shape. They weren’t just sharing experiences; they were living proof of growth. And in that moment, pride took over. Seeing where they started and where they stand today was incredibly fulfilling.

Naturally my answer, was ""I Like Finding Bugs in System/Software"", but all of us know that this answer is not satisfactory enough to persuade the interviewer, and factually this is not correct at a. So how do any one approach this question when asked? Over the course of two years, from my experiences, I have found few key points which are responsible for me being a software tester. And I think these are the few key points which you can really put forward in this situation. Remember every one can take a bat and hit a cricket ball, but to become asuccessful batsman like Rahul Dravid or Sachin Tendulkar, you need to have a definite set of skills, attitude and willingness to learn. If some HR asks me this question in any interview, I can say that I posses these very qualities, which I think would make me a perfect candidate- 1. The Big Picture Guy : This is the best thing about being a tester. You get to know of the bigger picture. As a tester you get to know the flow, how an application is supposed to work correctly. A developer might be concerned with his own modules, but not testers. For example a developer might be happy with his coded module, but a tester gotta verify if that module is working as per norms and integrating well with other modules as well. 2. The Sherlock Holmes : I love detective serials and I love Sherlock Holmes (I'm a fanboy seriously). Testing is a perfect opportunity for me to relive this fantasy. I get to be the Sherlock Holes, and look out for areas that can be hideous, deceptive and cause issues. 3. The Life Saver : Imagine the financial implications that a client and your company may face if the software developed is buggy. Not only will it result in financial loss, both to client and company, it will bring a bad reputation on your firm. You can be the perfect sentry and prevent all of this. 4. Coding Too : It is a myth that testers don't have to do coding or you will not get a chance at coding if you choose testing. Automation using tools like Selenium, SOAP UI, QTP, Jmeter require you to have a certain level of expertise and understanding of coding as well. 5. Creativity : As a tester, you have a lot of data to play with (believe me lots and lots of data). You need to be creative and thinker to get the most out of that data.You need to be creative to imagine all the possible scenarios-good or bad which might effect the software.

testerops,"The test automation process is a full time effort which requires significant time and effort. While developing a test automation framework, the most important thing is to clearly define the objectives of test automation . It is important to have a clear definition of what the test automation is supposed to achieve. Some of the baseline questions that needs to be asked are : 1.What is the shelf of the framework. 2.What percentage of application is going to be automated. 3. How stable is the application under test (AUT). 4. Testing skill of the target audience. 5. Who is the target audience for using the test framework. 6. Return of Investment on the automation efforts. Further, there are some desired capabilities that you should look out for in any test automation framework like : 7. Easy availability of the automation tests : The framework should be made as easy as it could be for the better use and understanding of the audience. Instead of offering a line by line scripting tests, it it more viable to have a offer a GUI related point and click interface for accessing and interating with the AUT. Testers should be able to visualize each step of the business scenario, view and edit test cases intuitively. This will shorten the learning curve for testers and help QA teams meet deadlines. 8. How Would You Want Your Data In Framework (V.Imp) : One of the most important points regarding test automation framework is how would you test large volumes of data quickly on the system quickly, and more importantly how would you get that data. You may have specific scenarios that require an object in a specific state. As a good measure of verification, you can use Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (data-driven) or database queries( keyword driven) to gather information to be tested. You can also leverage this to include database verification after a task has been completed.You must be able to manipulate the data sets, perform calculations, and quickly create hundreds of test iterations and permutations with minimal effort. 9. Reporting : What is the point of having all such manipulations and calculations, when no one can read and understand them. A test framework should define what should be a correct and well defined test result and report format, which should be generated automatically generate after a test run and show the results in an easy-to-read format. The reports should provide specifics about where application failures occurred and what test data was used. Reporting method like log reports and application screenshot at each step would be helpful in defining and highlighting any discrepancies and provide detailed explanations of each checkpoint pass and failure. Reports must also be easily shared across the entire QA and development teams. 10. Environment to support the test framework: This would include a continuous build system to launch a test suite at will, on schedule, or even after another event has occurred. With this environment, you can also run different suites of tests, such as smoke tests, functional tests, or browser-based tests. 11. Test Script and Coding Standards : The framework should define proper coding and scripting standards. This concept encourages testers to write code in an object-oriented manner. This allows reusable code to be incorporated throughout any given test. It can also assist in set-up tasks, such as preparing an environment or creating or refreshing database tables. The framework should define standards which would be helpful in making the test scripts consistent, readable and easily maintainable. 12. Maintenance friendly and proper documentation: The framework should be designed in such a way that it must be easy to use and maintain. By keeping clean code in an organized fashion, it becomes more of a tool than a hindrance. Documentation is always helpful when using the framework.

testerops,"With the advancement of scientific techniques and use of new machines and tools, we have been able to do a lot of good. Modern pharmaceuticals are one of the n-examples of this. Due to the use of new methods, techniques, tools, we have been able to eradicate and in many scenarios, at least able to control the damage done by various life-threatening diseases. But, even with all this technology by our side, the overall process of developing a drug is still something which takes a lot of time effort and finance. Due to this, pharmaceutical research is in a terrible bottleneck. It may take about 10 years and $1 billion in finances to create a new drug, which is a costly and time taking affair. As such, while pharma companies struggle to develop medicines, even for rich countries, and tropical diseases like Malaria, African Sleeping Sickness , Chagas Disease continue to be ignored and overlooked, because the cost and speed of drug discovery and the economic return makes them unattractive options for the pharma industry. But the scenario is slowly changing. More and more use of automation techniques and tools are coming up, which are making the tedious and time taking work of the chemists a lot easier. A perfect example of this blend of automation and scientific mind is the robot scientist-Eve. Eve is a robotic scientist, a culmination of minds of brilliant professors and researchers at University of Aberystwyth and Cambridge . Eve’s developers believe their Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology could speed up drug discovery, as she was created specifically to automate the early stages of drug design. It automates early-stage drug testing and design by using a series of tests that lend themselves to machine-screening at low cost at a rate of 10,000 tests a day.The AI-enabled robot is designed to add a new,advanced ability to learn, on top of all the other computation prowess that is uses. Instead of relying simply on brute-force testing of all available compounds, Eve takes a random subset of compounds, testing them a number of times to eliminate false results. Positive results are then analyzed using statistics and machine learning to predict new small molecule structures that are likely to return better results. The $1 million robot is designed in a way that eases it’s work pressure and allows it to operate with more freedom. It has two robotic arms- that are controlled by a computer server- that dance midst equipment for dispensing liquids into plastic plates containing large numbers of wells. These plates are then used in screening tests for potentially useful drug compounds. Drug molecules, in essence, act like tiny keys that slot into protein or enzyme locks. In the plates, each well holds a biochemical system containing a lock, and when a key fits into it the system triggers a detectable signal such as fluorescence. Initial signals—or hits—are usually found on one instrument before further tests are done elsewhere to check if the key really does fit the lock.Eve integrates these usually separate capabilities, accelerating the research process. How? Scientists use an existing mathematical model- called “ Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship “ (QSAR), which relates how a molecule’s composition, shape and properties such as electrical charge to how well it fits the lock. The model is fine, but even with all the computation power, it’s a method of slow trial-and-error. This is where Eve’s AI comes into play. The AI-contains a set of “a ctive learning ” capabilities, added over the conventional QSAR. The AI “learns” the characteristics of the keys, that would fit in the locks, by combing a set of about 5000 molecules. It then uses those characteristics, to predict which remaining numbers of collection- are likely to be hits or misses. According to the journal they published in The Royal Society this February, Eve discovered that a compound once investigated as a potential anti-cancer drug can block DHFR , a molecule found in the malaria parasite. Although treatments against the molecules exits, the researchers point out that , scientists are always looking for alternatives in case the parasites develop a resistance to conventional treatments. “ Despite extensive efforts, no one has been able to find a new antimalarial that targets DHFR and is able to pass clinical trials ,” says Professor Ross King, from the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology. “Eve’s discovery could be even more significant than just demonstrating a new approach to drug discovery.” So why choose automation? Why use a robot in the already tried and tested human approach ? Professor King says “ Every industry now benefits from automation and science is no exception. Bringing in machine learning to make this process intelligent — rather than just a ‘brute force’ approach — could greatly speed up scientific progress and potentially reap huge rewards .” . And obviously there are economic and effort benefits as well- commercial screening compounds are sold for around $15 per milligram, which is 10 times the price of gold. But such an effort comes with some critics and challenges as well. As Dr King cites- Eve currently does not have the capability to synthesize compounds that it can design based on its tests. Also the AI is still young, and she’s bound to go through more upgrades before she gets to help out more scientists and companies. Besides, critics like Derek Lowe, who runs a medical discovery blog called In The Pipeline , feels Eve “ seems like a natural consequence of the technologies we use already,” he says. “As with any automated system, my worry about Eve is that people will take its results at face value, never bothering to look under the hood ”. There are many critics, who want a face-off between a robot scientist like Eve and a real world chemist to see how it performs against them. Also the steep price of Eve- it costs $1 million per unit, and the technical know-how to maintain it, alone would dampen the spirits of some companies. Despite all these criticism and challenges, the team is optimistic of Eve’s abilities and the role it will be able to play in coming years. “ In the future AI systems will be deciding what to make and screen because they’re just better at some tasks than humans ,” he says.",2.0,0.0,4024,,12279,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],6303,6261,1051,1042,50,3,0,0,"with the advancement of scientific techniques and use of new machines and tools, we have been able to do a lot of good. modern pharmaceuticals are one of the n-examples of this. due to the use of new methods, techniques, tools, we have been able to eradicate and in many scenarios, at least able to control the damage done by various life-threatening diseases. but, even with all this technology by our side, the overall process of developing a drug is still something which takes a lot of time effort and finance. due to this, pharmaceutical research is in a terrible bottleneck. it may take about 10 years and 1 billion in finances to create a new drug, which is a costly and time taking affair. as such, while pharma companies struggle to develop medicines, even for rich countries, and tropical diseases like malaria, african sleeping sickness , chagas disease continue to be ignored and overlooked, because the cost and speed of drug discovery and the economic return makes them unattractive options for the pharma industry. but the scenario is slowly changing. more and more use of automation techniques and tools are coming up, which are making the tedious and time taking work of the chemists a lot easier. a perfect example of this blend of automation and scientific mind is the robot scientist-eve. eve is a robotic scientist, a culmination of minds of brilliant professors and researchers at university of aberystwyth and cambridge . eves developers believe their artificial intelligence ai technology could speed up drug discovery, as she was created specifically to automate the early stages of drug design. it automates early-stage drug testing and design by using a series of tests that lend themselves to machine-screening at low cost at a rate of 10,000 tests a day.the ai-enabled robot is designed to add a new,advanced ability to learn, on top of all the other computation prowess that is uses. instead of relying simply on brute-force testing of all available compounds, eve takes a random subset of compounds, testing them a number of times to eliminate false results. positive results are then analyzed using statistics and machine learning to predict new small molecule structures that are likely to return better results. the 1 million robot is designed in a way that eases its work pressure and allows it to operate with more freedom. it has two robotic arms- that are controlled by a computer server- that dance midst equipment for dispensing liquids into plastic plates containing large numbers of wells. these plates are then used in screening tests for potentially useful drug compounds. drug molecules, in essence, act like tiny keys that slot into protein or enzyme locks. in the plates, each well holds a biochemical system containing a lock, and when a key fits into it the system triggers a detectable signal such as fluorescence. initial signalsor hitsare usually found on one instrument before further tests are done elsewhere to check if the key really does fit the lock.eve integrates these usually separate capabilities, accelerating the research process. how?

testerops,"LinkedIn-as soon as we hear this name- professionals, jobs are the first two words that comes to everyone's minds. Not only it is a great place to turn in case you were looking for a job change or a job hunt, but it is actually a great place for someone to receive feedback, recommendations, inspiration, ideas, constructive criticism, professional lessons, and many more. In short, you'll get all the things that you need to gain from your professional network, through LinkedIn, and that too from the very comfort of your bed, sofa, or even your very own smartphone, anywhere in the world. In an online social networking platform, which is bustling with all kinds of professionals and users, it is important to build a good persona. It is crucial to get recognized among the plethora of people among the same career paths. But, this recognition or identity should not compromise on the very foundation of LinkedIn, which is professionalism. Whatever you do, or want to achieve, should be done, keeping in mind this very fact. And now a days, it seems many people are taking this very lightly, or at least seem to ignore the fact, that though, LinkedIn is a social network, it is not Facebook, or MySpace or Twitter. Over the past one-one and a half year, I have noticed a not-so-welcome change in the user base of LinkedIn. And this reflects directly in the LinkedIn feed that I have, which I see almost daily. And let me give you a brief show down of these posts- most of which are annoying and lack any sense of professionalism The Whatsapp group post. This is the most annoying kind of posts that I see now a days. And it's increasing day by day. In my daily feed, I can almost see one new Whatsapp group creation post everyday, where somebody would ask for the contact numbers, in pre-text of creating a group for helping people get jobs or for people from specific industry and so-on. I don't know how successful these groups are, but to me it seems plain old way of scamming/spamming and collecting phone numbers. The HashTag post. First it was Twitter, then Facebook, and now the trend seems to have caught up with LinkedIn too. We get it that some people think hashtags are cool way of describing what you're doing, but please do not make it laced with hash tags. It doesn't looks professional at all to me (may be I am old fashioned). Let me give you an example. I #completed my #Nyears with #SoAndSoCompany. #FeelingItWasJustYesterday. #LookingForManyMoreYears Please decide it for yourselves how good it sounds-considering the fact that gives your professional snapshot. Non-sense pictures post. While on one hand, I am a fan of having motivational posters and pictures posted, I am seriously bugged by people, who posts all kinds of non-sense pictures on here. Hopeless romatics posting romantic poems about their love and failure, the whatsapp pictures and the most annoying- decode this picture. Ugh! Please Stop! Ads/Contests This may be acceptable up to a certain point, but I have seen a lot of folks posting about contests, where the company would award 10 ipads or such to winning candidates. Primarily , all these are ads/spam posts and if by any chance, you have followed somebody from the company or the company itself, ruins the whole experience. Fake Profile posts. Not a new issue for any social networking website. But over the last year, I have seen a dramatic increase in no. of fake profiles. Posts about jobs abroad, and for folks with less skill set- seems to be the primary area of target for these fake profiles. A prime SEO tactic, it would seem.

"" believers will surely like this pic "". please stop making these kinds of stupid posts and posting all kinds of crap about this. we get that you believe in god, but this is not the place where you boast about it or ask other people to follow what you believe in.",-15,too_long,"linkedin-as soon as we hear this name- professionals, jobs are the first two words that comes to everyone's minds",everyone_pattern,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,3,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,1,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,61,61

testerops,"Career advice is in no short supply . In fact, you could probably spend the duration of your working life simply reading through the tips and advice already online. But as in all areas of life, the more common something is, generally speaking, the lower its value. Many oft repeated truisms are more about wish fulfillment than reality (sorry peddlers of endless, uncritical ""follow your passion!"" posts ). Plus, tips that everyone and their mother (and their college career counselor) knows are unlikely to give you an edge over the competition. So what are the true hidden gems of career advice, the truths that few people are willing to say out loud that can actually transform a mediocre career into a rockstar one? That's what a someone on question-and-answer site Quora wanted to know recently, asking: "" What are a few unique pieces of career advice that nobody ever mentions ?"" The community responded with plenty of uncommon, thought-provoking advice. Doing Your Job Well Is Not Enough Being excellent at your job is a surefire way to get ahead, right? Nope, say several responders, including Victor Wong, CEO of PaperG. ""Most people assume just doing their current assigned job well is enough--so many associates at law firms think doing all the paperwork and litigation properly is the road to partnership, and many PR account executives think that getting a few articles written about their clients will earn them a promotion,"" he writes, but ""becoming a principal, partner, or senior executive with P&L-level responsibility requires a completely separate set of skills from entry and mid-level jobs."" How do you make that leap? ""To make the big jump to the next level, they're really being benchmarked on their ability to deliver future value to the firm in ways that are not taught or explained to them: chiefly how much business are they are able to bring in,"" he asserts. ""People who can think of what to do and deliver are the ones who ultimately are more likely to get promoted to the top levels."" Another anonymous poster agrees: ""You don't become a star doing your job. You become a star making things happen."" Who You Work For Is Hugely Important We all wish we lived in a world where who you know matters less than what you can do, but that's often not reality, and not always for unhealthy reasons. Knowing the best in the business often means you've worked with the best, and people rightly admire that. ""You don't have to be passionate about the product you are selling. You don't have to be in the most glamorous industry. You don't have to work for the company with the best 'brand' identity or reputation in your chosen field,"" insists Jeremy Boudinet, director of marketing for startup Ambition. What does matter is who you've worked with. ""Few things are as valuable as going and working for somebody that is going to want to teach you anything and everything they know. You'll experience tremendous personal and professional growth if you have the best person mentoring you ,"" he says, so ""figure out where the absolute best person to work for would be, and go work for them."" ... So Is Where You Work Just like who you work for can deeply affect the fate of your career, where you work also has a massive impact. Just saying, 'I want to work in software or sales,' isn't enough. Nor, as Boudinet point out, is it enough just to fill your resume with impressive company names. Your destiny is influenced greatly by the destiny of the particular organization that employs you. Don't take a job with just any old company because it's in the right sector or impresses your friends. ""Your career is a boat and it is at the mercy of tides. No matter how talented you are it's a lot harder to break out in a sluggish situation/hierarchy/economy than a go-go environment. Even if you're a superstar at Sluggish Co., your upside trajectory (more often than not) is fractional to what an average/below average employee achieves at Rocket Ship Co,"" says an anonymous poster with the most up-voted answer. Being Seen as Super Busy Isn't Always a Good Thing Think high achievers work endless hours and are continuously busy ? Think again, writes Mira Zaslove, director of international sales and trading at FabExchange. ""Ironically the busier you appear, often the less you will move up. I've seen smart and dedicated employees fail to get promoted, because they have taken on too much, are working too hard, and appeared too frazzled,"" she reports. ""If you appear stressed, people will think you aren't prepared to take on more, and you'll miss opportunities for new and innovative projects."" Take a Tour When plotting your first (or next) big career move, many of us think very abstractly, musing in solitude or in front of Google about the joys of our supposed dream jobs. But the truth is you can't decide on a career without seeing the day-to-day reality of where and how you work --the concrete truth rather than the imagined reality. Don't make decisions without actually going and seeing for yourself. Alek Mirkovich, founder of campayn.com, once thought becoming an air traffic controller was a great idea, but then he took a tour of where he would actually be working. ""Every single guy was BALD! Playing around with a simulator is fun but apparently the real thing is stressful. Within 30 seconds I knew I wasn't going to be signing up for this!"" he remembers. Don't Hide Your Failures Failures are seen less as a signal of incompetence and more as a sign that you're willing to take a risk and innovate, according to Zaslove. ""Your team will respect you and your career will accelerate if people understand what you are doing and that you are taking risks. Most people do not view someone as credible if they are giving advice and recommendations, but not walking the walk,"" she claims. ""If you show that you are willing to take risks, and publicly falter, your team will feel confident taking risks too. Lead by example."" Execution Matters More Than Plans or Advice Many people are looking for the magic recipe of how to make their career take off, but many of the responders agree that there are some serious limits to what other people can tell you. ""Advice (like ideas) is not in short supply, there is plenty of it going around,"" writes coach Darren Beattie, for instance. ""It's not really the advice in the long run that matters, it's the execution of the advice by the person being advised. The greatest advice ever in the history of the human race is absolutely useless if you act/execute on none of it."" Or to put it another way, there's no real roadmap that you can blindly follow . The trick is figuring out what to apply and what to ignore for your own personal situation. That same popular anonymous responder sums this idea up well: ""Career tracks and meritocracies don't exist: Your career is not a linear, clearly defined trajectory."" What less well known bit of career wisdom would you add to this list?",37.0,0.0,4224,,12279,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],6951,6936,1206,1206,63,6,3,0,"career advice is in no short supply . in fact, you could probably spend the duration of your working life simply reading through the tips and advice already online. but as in all areas of life, the more common something is, generally speaking, the lower its value. many oft repeated truisms are more about wish fulfillment than reality sorry peddlers of endless, uncritical ""follow your passion!"" posts . plus, tips that everyone and their mother and their college career counselor knows are unlikely to give you an edge over the competition. so what are the true hidden gems of career advice, the truths that few people are willing to say out loud that can actually transform a mediocre career into a rockstar one? that's what a someone on question-and-answer site quora wanted to know recently, asking: "" what are a few unique pieces of career advice that nobody ever mentions ?"" the community responded with plenty of uncommon, thought-provoking advice. doing your job well is not enough being excellent at your job is a surefire way to get ahead, right? nope, say several responders, including victor wong, ceo of paperg.

shubham-kumar-mittal-674a89122,"We used to measure time in BC & AD. Now it feels like life is split into BI & AI - Before Inflation & After Inflation. Somewhere after 2020, the baseline shifted. Not dramatically. Quietly. Permanently. Here are 10 things that didn’t just get expensive. They got redefined. 1. Coffee meetings → Financial decisions Catching up over coffee used to be casual. Now two cappuccinos and a dessert cross ₹900. The conversation is still light. The bill isn’t. 2. Weddings → Multi-day productions What was once a family function is now a staged event. Pre-shoots. Entry concepts. Hashtags. Guest experience teams. The emotional value is real. The financial escalation is unreal. 3. Kids’ schooling → Corporate pricing logic Annual fees. Activity fees. Tech fees. International exposure fees. Education didn’t just inflate. It repositioned itself as a premium service. 4. Eating healthy → Paying a premium for basics Cold-pressed oils. Organic vegetables. Farm milk. A simple shift toward “clean eating” quietly doubles the grocery bill. 5. Convenience → Subscription traps Music. Cloud storage. Fitness apps. Meditation apps. AI tools. Individually small. Collectively significant. Convenience now compounds monthly. 6. Moving homes → A capital event Security deposits. Brokerage. Interiors. Appliances. Curtains. Moving isn’t a logistical exercise anymore. It’s a financial project. 7. Gyms → Lifestyle clubs What was ₹12k per year is now ₹45k — with juice bars, recovery zones, and “community.” Fitness became an ecosystem. Pricing followed. 8. Work essentials → Personal expenses Better chair. Better desk. Better mic. Better lighting. Work from home quietly shifted infrastructure costs from companies to individuals. 9. Travel mindset → Travel justification Earlier: “Let’s go somewhere.” Now: “Is it worth the cost?” The emotional spontaneity lost to financial calculation. 10.

debashishghosh1,"First things first, this is NOT a list of Top 4 events of 2017. If anything, unfortunately, 2017 could well be remembered as the year of deadly hurricanes. Hurricanes Maria, Jose, Harvey and Irma caused unimaginable human tragedy last year. Besides, North Korea and Donald Trump hit the headlines almost every day. Rohingya crisis, Robert Mugabe, Fall of Mosul, Las Vegas mass shooting….the list could go on. In this list, I have picked up four events from 2017 that could potentially have far-reaching impact in years to come – in the fields of finance , economy and corporate governance only . I have heavily read, researched and borrowed opinions from many “Top 10” listings, experts’ views, and white papers. In a way, this is a “list of lists”. And yes, these are not in any particular order. The Paradise Papers leak In November, German newspaper the Süddeutsche Zeitung released millions of leaked documents relating to offshore investments of about 120000 individuals and corporations. Most of these documents originated from the Bermuda-based law firm Appleby, which confirmed that it had been targeted by a cyberattack in 2016. The papers contained details of financial holdings and offshore investments by 100 multinational companies including Apple, Disney, Facebook, Twitter, McDonald's, Uber, Nike, Allergen, Siemens, Walmart and Allianz, who are allegedly avoided billions of dollars in tax using offshore companies. Apple criticized the reports as inaccurate and misleading, saying that it is the largest taxpayer in the world and that it "" pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world "". We certainly have not heard the last on this matter yet. The allegations, if proven right, would have implications with regards to corporate governance and ethics. 2. Mohammad bin Salman Remakes Saudi Arabia Few people outside Saudi Arabia had heard of Prince Mohammed bin Salman before his father became king in 2015. In June 2017, after being elevated to the position of crown prince, he engaged McKinsey’s consultants to help design his “Vision 2030"", the sweeping reform agenda aimed at ushering Saudi Arabia into a more open, post-petroleum future. NBC news reports that “the reforms are aimed at transforming the way the world sees Saudi Arabia, wean it off of oil and remake the hermetic Gulf kingdom into a hub of international business, finance and technology” . The plan also envisaged changing the education curriculum, increasing women's participation in the workforce, and investing in the entertainment sector to help create jobs for young people. Prince Mohammed was also given much of the credit for King Salman's announcement that a ban on women drivers would end in June 2018, despite opposition from conservatives. These reforms would significantly impact the economy, society and culture of the country and the region, and have rippling effects around the world. I’ll be watching keenly. 3. Bitcoin price Bitcoin caused a financial frenzy in 2017. Its popularity surged last year as its value continued to rise and the promise of cryptocurrency inspired millions around the world to join the exciting, yet risky venture. At the start of the year, its price was hovering around $1,000. It reached its all-time high of $19,843 per coin, which it hit around December 17, 2017, before a sharp fall in which it briefly dipped below $14,000 by the end of the year. Last year also saw Bitcoin gaining more legitimacy among lawmakers and legacy financial companies. Japan passed a law to accept bitcoin as a legal payment method, and Russia has announced that it will legalize the use of cryptocurrencies. On the legitimacy of cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, expert opinion continues to be divided along the lines of optimism and skepticism. I have not taken any sides yet – still decoding all the tech jargon. 4. Sexual harassment scandals and the rise of #MeToo In early October, reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed that film mogul Harvey Weinstein allegedly lured women into hotel rooms and bars, and sexually harassed or assaulted them in what some have described as an open secret known for years in Hollywood. Later that month, after a tweet from actor Alyssa Milano, who was one of Weinstein’s accusers, social media was flooded with personal stories of victims of sexual harassment, all using the hashtag #MeToo. By the end of the year, many men in entertainment, business, politics and the news media were publicly condemned for their alleged sexual misconduct and many have lost their jobs as a result, including Weinstein. Earlier in February 2017, a female engineer who used to work at Uber published a blog post about sexual harassment and gender inequality at the company. That blog, and a few subsequent reports of organizational sexism and gender bias at Uber, forced Travis Kalanick, the founder-CEO, to resign from the firm.

ceposta,"MCP servers are cropping up all over the enterprise like weeds in a nice lawn. And just like weeds, this can cause problems. MCP servers should be secured, but how? The official spec says use OAuth , but that is not appropriate within an enterprise organization. On a recent LinkedIn post I made the point: Any internal enterprise MCP client / AI agent that communicates to an [remote] MCP server should be secured with enterprise SSO. If the agent is acting autonomously, then agent identity should be enforced. But that is for a different post … (check out my 5 part series on Entra Agent ID). A lot of enterprise organizations use Microsoft Entra ID for their enterprise IdP. In this blog, we take a look at securing ALL MCP access with Entra ID SSO. SSO has been around for a long time, so what’s the big difference here? They main thing is SSO is usually done in browser based applications. MCP clients are not usually browser applications. For example, VS code, Cursor, Claude, and other AI agents can run on a desktop, mobile, or cloud environment. A browser may be “around” but they are not always the direct interface. So for us to accomplish SSO from an MCP client to an MCP server, the MCP protocol must support it. OIDC is based on OAuth, and we can perform OIDC logins by leveraging the MCP Authorization spec. And we can do this consistently for all agents/MCP clients regardless of what the backend MCP server is (ie, running within enterprise, hosted by a vendor, SaaS, etc). By tying to enterprise SSO we can apply policy to the MCP usage before it reaches the MCP server. Is this client allowed to access this MCP server? What tools are they allowed to see? Agentgateway is a powerful opensource (Linux Foundation) MCP gateway that implements the MCP Authorization spec. That means we don’t have to try and re-write all MCP servers to use Entra. We can do it automatically from an MCP gateway. Let’s look at an example configuration for Agentgateway: mcpAuthentication: mode: strict issuer: https://sts.windows.net/${ENTRA_TENANT_ID}/ jwks: url: https://login.microsoftonline.com/${ENTRA_TENANT_ID}/discovery/v2.0/keys audiences: - api://b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec resourceMetadata: authorizationServers: - https://login.microsoftonline.com/${ENTRA_TENANT_ID}/v2.0 resource: https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp scopesSupported: - api://b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec/mcp_access # - openid # - profile bearerMethodsSupported: - header - body - query resourceDocumentation: https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/docs resourcePolicyUri: https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/policies This piece of YAML is all that’s needed to implement the MCP Authorization spec to force SSO flows to ANY MCP server hosted on the gateway. The real detail is in how we configure Entra for this. Digging into Entra ID for MCP SSO To use Entra ID for this, we need to set up an Entra App Registration. This will be used to represent our Agentgateway. Can the MCP client access our Agentgateway? We want the Entra ID tokens to be scoped for this. Any other complex authorization policy can be handled with Agentgateway and potentially calling out to a ReBAC engine like OpenFGA . This Entra stuff takes some attention to detail, so let’s follow it step by step setting up an App Registration for Agentgateway. Step 1. Create App Registration Click “Create Application” to begin the registration process. We won’t add any redirect URIs since this app is just used to represent the Agentgateway application, it won’t be doing any oauth flows itself. The MCP clients do that. Step 2. App Registration Configured Once the application registration is created, you can see things like it’s service principal / client_id (b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec in our case). You don’t need to add any credentials to this app, but we do want to configure scopes that can be requested so that Entra can correctly configure the aud claim in any tokens it issues. Step 3. Add Scopes Click “Expose an API” –> “Add a Scope”: Step 4. Configure Scope for Agentgateway access Adding a new scope called mcp_access, leave it as Admin consent and fill in some details that would be displayed on any consent screens. To request the scope, you use the full scope name: api://b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec/mcp_access Step 5. (Optional - Recommended) add pre-consented Clients Lastly, we can configure which clients are allowed to request these scopes. For example, we can add the public VS Code client (ie, it’s baked into VS code): aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56. Testing MCP SSO + Entra We can run our agentgateway (see source code ): agentgateway -f ./config/agentgateway.yaml And if we go to VS Code, we can add our new server: Step 1. Add MCP Server Step 2. Configure Streamable HTTP MCP Server Step 3. Configure MCP URL Step 4. Agree to Peform SSO Login Step 5. Review MCP Config in mcp.json Using your own MCP Clients In VS Code (and Cursor, Claude, etc) the MCP client ID is baked in. But if you have your own MCP clients, or AI agents, or just want to configure your own OAuth clients for MCP access, you can do that in the Entra dashboard. Step 1. Create a new App Registration (Public client is fine) Step 2. Configure correct Redirect URIs At this point you can use your own OAuth client_ids. Caveat for MCP Inspector MCP Inspector very closely follows the MCP Authorization spec, and unforunately for Entra ID this casues some issues. For example, if we take a look at our OAuth Protected Resource Metadata (PRM): { ""resource"": ""https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp"", ""authorization_servers"": [ ""https://login.microsoftonline.com/5e7d8166-7876-4755-a1a4-b476d4a344f6/v2.0"" ], ""scopes_supported"": [ ""api://b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec/mcp_access"" ], ""bearer_methods_supported"": [ ""header"", ""body"", ""query"" ], ""resource_documentation"": ""https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/docs"", ""resource_policy_uri"": ""https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/policies"", ""mcp_protocol_version"": ""2025-06-18"", ""resource_type"": ""mcp-server"" } You can see our Agentgateway correctly returns the PRM. A client should be able to automatically continue the OAuth/OIDC flow from this. HOWEVER. You can see the resource field gets set to ""https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp"", This causes an issue in MCP inspector (not VS Code or other clients) because MCP inspector uses this field in the Authorization request. It sets the resource parameter based on this value (according to spec): resource=https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp scope=api%3A%2F%2Fb92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec%2Fmcp_access The problem is, this is not the correct resource in Entra. The correct resouce in entra is our api://b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec client_id. If we configure the Agentgateway to return this in our PRM, then that breaks the rest of the OAuth flow, since that’s not the real URL for our MCP resource. The fix here is to: Make MCP Inspector more flexible to override the resource sent in the auth flows Use a verified custom domain the app registration resource URI. If you are doing this in production, you’d want to user a verified custom domain. Alternatively, in your custom MCP clients, make a way to override the resource parameter when calling tha authorize endpoint and use the real client_id like this example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize? response_type=code& client_id=9beda151-9370-42f2-a2f7-17933c5c5a7c& code_challenge=BPfzTvHnOhmbZyB8aIW3sCG69vLmF_hG3aQRvl5C31s& code_challenge_method=S256& redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A6274%2Foauth%2Fcallback%2Fdebug& state=38158e70909ff3264e129b13b3927b34dc299a7d2dea3b9ee62ca0f181e83db5& scope=api%3A%2F%2Fb92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec%2Fmcp_access& resource=api%3A%2F%2Fb92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec Wrapping Up The right pattern for enterprise MCP usage is to tie access to the internal IdP and SSO. All policy should be written against these user IDs (and groups, claims, etc). For more complex auth flows that require cross-identity OAuth ie, like if you need to call GitHub MCP servers, or Databricks, etc each which have their own IdP separate from enterprise IdP, then you can do that also with Agentgateway Enterprise:",106.0,8.0,23,,12127,article,0,13,1,"['https://sts.windows.net/$', 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/$', 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/$', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/docs', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/policies', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp', 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/5e7d8166-7876-4755-a1a4-b476d4a344f6/v2.0', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/docs', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp/policies', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp', 'https://ceposta-agw.ngrok.io/entra/mcp', 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?']",0,[],0,0,[],0,[],8254,7565,1179,1169,72,6,0,0,"mcp servers are cropping up all over the enterprise like weeds in a nice lawn. and just like weeds, this can cause problems. mcp servers should be secured, but how? the official spec says use oauth , but that is not appropriate within an enterprise organization. on a recent linkedin post i made the point: any internal enterprise mcp client  ai agent that communicates to an remote mcp server should be secured with enterprise sso. if the agent is acting autonomously, then agent identity should be enforced. but that is for a different post  check out my 5 part series on entra agent id. a lot of enterprise organizations use microsoft entra id for their enterprise idp. in this blog, we take a look at securing all mcp access with entra id sso. sso has been around for a long time, so whats the big difference here? they main thing is sso is usually done in browser based applications. mcp clients are not usually browser applications. for example, vs code, cursor, claude, and other ai agents can run on a desktop, mobile, or cloud environment. a browser may be around but they are not always the direct interface. so for us to accomplish sso from an mcp client to an mcp server, the mcp protocol must support it. oidc is based on oauth, and we can perform oidc logins by leveraging the mcp authorization spec. and we can do this consistently for all agentsmcp clients regardless of what the backend mcp server is ie, running within enterprise, hosted by a vendor, saas, etc. by tying to enterprise sso we can apply policy to the mcp usage before it reaches the mcp server. is this client allowed to access this mcp server? what tools are they allowed to see? agentgateway is a powerful opensource linux foundation mcp gateway that implements the mcp authorization spec. that means we dont have to try and re-write all mcp servers to use entra. we can do it automatically from an mcp gateway. lets look at an example configuration for agentgateway: mcpauthentication: mode: strict issuer: urlentratenantid jwks: url: urlentratenantiddiscoveryv2.0keys audiences: -

recommended add pre-consented clients lastly, we can configure which clients are allowed to request these scopes. for example, we can add the public vs code client ie, its baked into vs code: aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56. testing mcp sso  entra we can run our agentgateway see source code : agentgateway -f .configagentgateway.yaml and if we go to vs code, we can add our new server: step 1. add mcp server step 2. configure streamable http mcp server step 3. configure mcp url step 4. agree to peform sso login step 5. review mcp config in mcp.json using your own mcp clients in vs code and cursor, claude, etc the mcp client id is baked in. but if you have your own mcp clients, or ai agents, or just want to configure your own oauth clients for mcp access, you can do that in the entra dashboard. step 1. create a new app registration public client is fine step 2. configure correct redirect uris at this point you can use your own oauth clientids. caveat for mcp inspector mcp inspector very closely follows the mcp authorization spec, and unforunately for entra id this casues some issues. for example, if we take a look at our oauth protected resource metadata prm:  ""resource"": ""url"", ""authorizationservers"":  ""url"" , ""scopessupported"":  ""api:b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ecmcpaccess"" , ""bearermethodssupported"":  ""header"", ""body"", ""query"" , ""resourcedocumentation"": ""url"", ""resourcepolicyuri"": ""url"", ""mcpprotocolversion"": ""2025-06-18"", ""resourcetype"": ""mcp-server""  you can see our agentgateway correctly returns the prm. a client should be able to automatically continue the oauthoidc flow from this. however. you can see the resource field gets set to ""url"", this causes an issue in mcp inspector not vs code or other clients because mcp inspector uses this field in the authorization request. it sets the resource parameter based on this value according to spec: resourceurl scopeapi3a2f2fb92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec2fmcpaccess the problem is, this is not the correct resource in entra. the correct resouce in entra is our api:b92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec clientid. if we configure the agentgateway to return this in our prm, then that breaks the rest of the oauth flow, since thats not the real url for our mcp resource. the fix here is to: make mcp inspector more flexible to override the resource sent in the auth flows use a verified custom domain the app registration resource uri. if you are doing this in production, youd want to user a verified custom domain. alternatively, in your custom mcp clients, make a way to override the resource parameter when calling tha authorize endpoint and use the real clientid like this example: url responsetypecode clientid9beda151-9370-42f2-a2f7-17933c5c5a7c codechallengebpfztvhnohmbzyb8aiw3scg69vlmfhg3aqrvl5c31s codechallengemethods256 redirecturihttp3a2f2flocalhost3a62742foauth2fcallback2fdebug state38158e70909ff3264e129b13b3927b34dc299a7d2dea3b9ee62ca0f181e83db5 scopeapi3a2f2fb92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec2fmcpaccess resourceapi3a2f2fb92d6e60-86ff-4359-b971-04404fe079ec wrapping up the right pattern for enterprise mcp usage is to tie access to the internal idp and sso. all policy should be written against these user ids and groups, claims, etc. for more complex auth flows that require cross-identity oauth ie, like if you need to call github mcp servers, or databricks, etc each which have their own idp separate from enterprise idp, then you can do that also with agentgateway enterprise:",-15,too_long,mcp servers are cropping up all over the enterprise like weeds in a nice lawn,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,-18,2,-7,1,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18,18

During the panel with SMU Business Intelligence and Analytics , the students asked the hard question: “How do we find jobs in this current climate?” My answer: Don’t let your degree define your career. I pivoted from Finance to AI because I looked at what was on the horizon. The specific subject you study matters less than our judgment. We must spot the trends, build the expertise early, and be ready when the role appears.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"Who is a man, and Who is a Woman? Are we not one? Yes, indeed. Gender equality is no longer a myth, rather, it's high time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals. The soul has no gender, and so do I, rather, we all. A sustainable and successful work environment demands a plethora of skills and competencies, and certainly that's not achievable from any one group of people having a particular arrangement of chromosomes. Men tend to be decisive, confident and bold while taking risks, whereas, women tend to be protective, inclusive, detail-oriented and aware. Henceforth, for a better tomorrow, what is really needed is to provide the full array of expertise to all people, and not just some. We all believe that teamwork is the heart of great achievement. True teamwork means the team members are open to share ideas, help one another, complement each other and be receptive to feedback. If that is so, then diverse teams significantly contribute more towards productivity. To achieve such a harmonious experience, all that we need is to have a general awareness on gender intelligence. To put it simple, we need to appreciate our differences and look forward towards ways of complementing them while being careful to our own individuality; because one can only make a difference, but together we can rock the world. The biggest example for this is my company, SAP Labs India. SAP Labs India is a hotspot of diversity and inclusiveness. The company values men and women in equality endowed with the same dignity. There are equal opportunities, appreciation and celebration for both the sex, because what matters here is the talent, the abilities, the versatility and the prowess.We have a lot of work to do and we get there by working together as our strength lies in the differences and not in the sameness. We make gender equality a lived reality, a cherished virtue and a promising opportunity for one and all. On the advent of International Men's Day 2017, I look forward to resolve the problem with gender that prescribes how we should be, rather than recognizing how we are. #diversity #diversityandinclusion #genderdiversity #genderequity #genderintelligenc e",11.0,0.0,3005,,15850,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],5,"['#diversity', '#diversityandinclusion', '#genderdiversity', '#genderequity', '#genderintelligenc']",2206,2206,369,369,21,2,0,0,"who is a man, and who is a woman? are we not one? yes, indeed. gender equality is no longer a myth, rather, it's high time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals. the soul has no gender, and so do i, rather, we all. a sustainable and successful work environment demands a plethora of skills and competencies, and certainly that's not achievable from any one group of people having a particular arrangement of chromosomes. men tend to be decisive, confident and bold while taking risks, whereas, women tend to be protective, inclusive, detail-oriented and aware. henceforth, for a better tomorrow, what is really needed is to provide the full array of expertise to all people, and not just some. we all believe that teamwork is the heart of great achievement. true teamwork means the team members are open to share ideas, help one another, complement each other and be receptive to feedback. if that is so, then diverse teams significantly contribute more towards productivity. to achieve such a harmonious experience, all that we need is to have a general awareness on gender intelligence. to put it simple, we need to appreciate our differences and look forward towards ways of complementing them while being careful to our own individuality; because one can only make a difference, but together we can rock the world. the biggest example for this is my company, sap labs india. sap labs india is a hotspot of diversity and inclusiveness. the company values men and women in equality endowed with the same dignity. there are equal opportunities, appreciation and celebration for both the sex, because what matters here is the talent, the abilities, the versatility and the prowess.we have a lot of work to do and we get there by working together as our strength lies in the differences and not in the sameness. we make gender equality a lived reality, a cherished virtue and a promising opportunity for one and all. on the advent of international men's day 2017, i look forward to resolve the problem with gender that prescribes how we should be, rather than recognizing how we are. #diversity #diversityandinclusion #genderdiversity #genderequity #genderintelligenc e",-15,too_long,"who is a man, and who is a woman",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,-7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,39,39

debashishghosh1,"The Outward Mindset: Seeing Beyond Ourselves by The Arbinger Institute If you are looking the author’s name, you are not getting one! This book builds on Arbinger Institute’s 35 years of work helping individuals and organizations to be more effective, innovative and collaborative. It essentially talks about how having the right mindset is the key to success and growth of any organization – as mindsets drive behaviors and behaviors drive results. There are two mindsets – Outward and Inward. With an outward mindset, we see others as people like ourselves, whose needs, objectives and challenges matter to us. An inward mindset, on the other hand, is very self-focused, where we see others as objects and consider only those options that would advance and protect our own agendas. By sharing true and compelling stories of individual leaders and client organizations, Arbinger leads us to the journey of achieving outward mindset. If you are looking for a “how to” guide to drive organizational culture and change in your organization, this is the book to read. I know it because my own organization has greatly benefitted by implementing the profound guidance and tools from this book and from another Arbinger masterpiece “Leadership and Self-deception”. Thinking Fast and Slow: Daniel Kahneman I saw this book featuring in every “Best-Business-Books-Of-All-Time” List. I had to read it! I did, and it is indeed one of the greatest books of all time! This book summarizes Nobel-laureate Daniel Kahneman’s research of over three decades. The central theme of this is about how human beings use two different “systems” for making decisions and judgments. System 1 is fast, intuitive, unconscious and emotional. System 2 is slow, logical, effortful and calculating. Kahneman covers a lifetime of experiments in order to highlight the differences between these two systems and how they arrive at different results even given the same inputs. Each chapter in the book is a gem, covering various facets of decision-making backed by empirical research. I favorite in the one where he takes on Jim Collins and his best-selling book “Good To Great”. Unlike Collins’ claim that inspirational leadership and culture are the drivers behind successful organizations, Kahneman (statistically) argues that luck and a regression to the mean are more impactful than Collins credits. An interesting diversity of thoughts of two great thinkers! This is not a book for those who have a-book-every-week goals. This is a slow read. You will need to use your System 2. Moonwalking with Einstein: Joshua Foer Joshua Foer was a young journalist when he went to cover the United States Memory Championship. He was so fascinated by the idea of memory improvement and with the “memory athletes” that he actually went on to participate in the Championship the following year. And won it! I read about this incredible story in another article and I was hooked immediately. I started reading the book expecting to read about his incredible and personal journey from being a reporter to a memory champion within a year. But the book offers much more. Besides being a personal account, the book chronicles the history and transformation of human memory by drawing on cutting-edge research. It also shares the techniques that humankind has used to improve memory. Personally, I have always struggled with my memory. I have an amazing (dis)ability to forget names, articles, places etc. within a very short time. If you are someone like me and want to improve your memory, read this book. Winning on HR Analytics: Soundararajan and Singh I have been reading up a lot on HR Analytics off late. This book was the first one I picked on this subject. I like it when business books are written by successful business professionals. Both Soundararajan and Singh have had hugely successful careers on their own. Their experience shows in their writing. The book does not try to impress you by being esoteric and intellectualistic. What you get here are some practical, insightful case studies written with a focus on implementation. A word of caution though. This is not a book for senior HR professionals with a deep exposure to analytics. If you are looking to learn advanced statistical tools like regression, variance, decision tree etc., this one is not for you (for that, I recommend – “Business Analytics: The Science of Data - Driven Decision Making” by U Dinesh Kumar). This one for HR professionals, young or otherwise, who are interested in fundamentals. This is the first book on HR Analytics they should read. Tuesdays with Morrie: Mitch Albom A true, poignant account of the author (Mitch Albom is a journalist and best-selling author) and Morrie Schwartz, the college professor who had taught him nearly 20 years before. While Albom was working a sports columnist for the Detroit Free Press , he saw his professor Morrie Schwartz appear on television recounting his experience of dealing with ALS (ALS is a non-curable disease that causes the death of neurons controlling the voluntary muscles, resulting in a slow and painful death of the afflicted) . An ensuing newspaper strike allows Albom to visit Schwartz every week, on Tuesdays. The book recounts each of the fourteen visits Albom made to Schwartz, before his eventual death. In each of these 14 visits (chapters in the book), Schwartz shares his experiences and his own interpretations of life’s events, with generous dollops of positivity and sense of humor. I loved all the Tuesdays. But if you are in the bookstore, pick it up and read the fifth Tuesday where Schwartz talk about his views on family. Soul-stirring. Catalyst: Chandramouli Venkatesan This is a book on career management written by someone who had a hugely successful corporate career. Mouli, as he is commonly called, has served in senior capacities, including as CEO and MD, in major organizations such as Asian Paints, Cadbury and Pidilite. In this book, Mouli captured real insights from everyday events and offers practical advice on career. I loved his take on some of the most discussed career-related topics, such as long stints in a company and impact of boss in one’s career. There is no dearth of books on career growth and professional success. This one is different because it draws from Mouli’s personal experience and insights. I highly recommend it for young professionals launching their careers. For experienced professionals, I can assure you some “aha” moments. Which are the books you read recently and really liked? Would love to know about those.

this book builds on arbinger institutes 35 years of work helping individuals and organizations to be more effective, innovative and collaborative. it essentially talks about how having the right mindset is the key to success and growth of any organization  as mindsets drive behaviors and behaviors drive results. there are two mindsets  outward and inward. with an outward mindset, we see others as people like ourselves, whose needs, objectives and challenges matter to us. an inward mindset, on the other hand, is very self-focused, where we see others as objects and consider only those options that would advance and protect our own agendas. by sharing true and compelling stories of individual leaders and client organizations, arbinger leads us to the journey of achieving outward mindset. if you are looking for a how to guide to drive organizational culture and change in your organization, this is the book to read. i know it because my own organization has greatly benefitted by implementing the profound guidance and tools from this book and from another arbinger masterpiece leadership and self-deception. thinking fast and slow: daniel kahneman i saw this book featuring in every best-business-books-of-all-time list. i had to read it! i did, and it is indeed one of the greatest books of all time! this book summarizes nobel-laureate daniel kahnemans research of over three decades. the central theme of this is about how human beings use two different systems for making decisions and judgments. system 1 is fast, intuitive, unconscious and emotional. system 2 is slow, logical, effortful and calculating. kahneman covers a lifetime of experiments in order to highlight the differences between these two systems and how they arrive at different results even given the same inputs. each chapter in the book is a gem, covering various facets of decision-making backed by empirical research. i favorite in the one where he takes on jim collins and his best-selling book good to great. unlike collins claim that inspirational leadership and culture are the drivers behind successful organizations, kahneman statistically argues that luck and a regression to the mean are more impactful than collins credits. an interesting diversity of thoughts of two great thinkers! this is not a book for those who have a-book-every-week goals. this is a slow read. you will need to use your system 2. moonwalking with einstein: joshua foer joshua foer was a young journalist when he went to cover the united states memory championship. he was so fascinated by the idea of memory improvement and with the memory athletes that he actually went on to participate in the championship the following year. and won it! i read about this incredible story in another article and i was hooked immediately. i started reading the book expecting to read about his incredible and personal journey from being a reporter to a memory champion within a year. but the book offers much more. besides being a personal account, the book chronicles the history and transformation of human memory by drawing on cutting-edge research. it also shares the techniques that humankind has used to improve memory. personally, i have always struggled with my memory. i have an amazing disability to forget names, articles, places etc. within a very short time. if you are someone like me and want to improve your memory, read this book. winning on hr analytics: soundararajan and singh i have been reading up a lot on hr analytics off late. this book was the first one i picked on this subject. i like it when business books are written by successful business professionals. both soundararajan and singh have had hugely successful careers on their own. their experience shows in their writing. the book does not try to impress you by being esoteric and intellectualistic. what you get here are some practical, insightful case studies written with a focus on implementation. a word of caution though. this is not a book for senior hr professionals with a deep exposure to analytics. if you are looking to learn advanced statistical tools like regression, variance, decision tree etc., this one is not for you for that, i recommend  business analytics: the science of data - driven decision making by u dinesh kumar. this one for hr professionals, young or otherwise, who are interested in fundamentals. this is the first book on hr analytics they should read. tuesdays with morrie: mitch albom a true, poignant account of the author mitch albom is a journalist and best-selling author and morrie schwartz, the college professor who had taught him nearly 20 years before. while albom was working a sports columnist for the detroit free press , he saw his professor morrie schwartz appear on television recounting his experience of dealing with als als is a non-curable disease that causes the death of neurons controlling the voluntary muscles, resulting in a slow and painful death of the afflicted . an ensuing newspaper strike allows albom to visit schwartz every week, on tuesdays. the book recounts each of the fourteen visits albom made to schwartz, before his eventual death. in each of these 14 visits chapters in the book, schwartz shares his experiences and his own interpretations of lifes events, with generous dollops of positivity and sense of humor. i loved all the tuesdays. but if you are in the bookstore, pick it up and read the fifth tuesday where schwartz talk about his views on family. soul-stirring. catalyst: chandramouli venkatesan this is a book on career management written by someone who had a hugely successful corporate career. mouli, as he is commonly called, has served in senior capacities, including as ceo and md, in major organizations such as asian paints, cadbury and pidilite. in this book, mouli captured real insights from everyday events and offers practical advice on career. i loved his take on some of the most discussed career-related topics, such as long stints in a company and impact of boss in ones career. there is no dearth of books on career growth and professional success. this one is different because it draws from moulis personal experience and insights. i highly recommend it for young professionals launching their careers. for experienced professionals, i can assure you some aha moments. which are the books you read recently and really liked? would love to know about those. happy reading!",-15,too_long,"the outward mindset: seeing beyond ourselves by the arbinger institute if you are looking the authors name, you are not getting one",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,7,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,12,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,86,86

No burning tokens on 10 minutes of ""are we there yet?"" calls — just a simple while loop with subprocess calls. Zero cost, zero hallucination risk. The result? → Researches the topic across the web → Ingests sources into NotebookLM → Waits patiently until ready (deterministic gate) → Generates 3 artifacts: blog, infographic, slides → Downloads everything to organized output folders Key lessons from building this: ✅ Separate concerns into phases — don't let one mega-agent do everything ✅ Use deterministic gates between async operations — LLMs are terrible pollers ✅ Isolate tool permissions per agent — principle of least privilege via MCP filters ✅ Always verify — add Python-level checks after every agent step The future of AI isn't one model doing everything.

testerops,"Found this interesting post on Quora, which was also published in Forbes. This answer by Nachiket Naik is brilliant round -up of many of the programmers out there- even in MNC's. 1) The StackOverflow bot: This person ran into an error, did a quick Google search and applied the first solution they found. The problem here is not that of copying from Stackoverflow. I think there are more solutions on Stackoverflow than any reference guide or manual. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful resource, if not the best. The problem is the robotic application of it without understanding the consequences. The problem is the application of it without fully understanding the context of it and whether it really applies to the current problem at hand. More often than not, I have seen people believe more of what they see on online forums than the code/system in front of them. 2) The I-am-not-a-tester: I don't need to test the code, that is the job of the testers. I don't think that even in this age of mature Agile methodologies, this attitude has waned. There is still an inertia against testing their code. Part of it comes from lacking the interest to set up a testing environment and partly from lack of coherent knowledge of testing. (Is it also partly due to an unspoken stigma against testers in the developer community.) 3) The I-hate-documentation: Some people believe that code documentation must be poetic and hence they lack the skill to do it, ergo not their job. In my opinion, these are the #1 foes of sustainable software. Good software is not software that provides a million cool features. Good software is one that has a few good features that are used consistently by many people and read/updated/modified by a thousand . This brand of developers who believes less in technical communication and precise and detailed documentation is the greatest weed to a company's success. 4) The ugly: My code works, but: I have variables named x, flag, str, arr, etc. Most of what I write is in one giant method. There is no indentation. No consistent coding convention or style. Global variables spewed all over the place, etc. This is the most annoying thing for me personally. It's not the issue that the code is bad. It could potentially be the greatest piece of code written. But if a diamond necklace is buried in the debris of the Titanic, nobody will find it, and nobody will want to clean it, wear it, use it. 5) The short-term investor: He codes. He deploys. He moves on. No attempt to learn the problem. No interest in the domain. Just give this guy a piece of code, he will slog on it overnight and hand it over. You got a fix/working software. Nothing more achieved from it. Sometimes, it's important that you have certain selfishness in the developer, one who not only cares about the deadline, but also cares about what he/she got to learn from it. 6) The protester: ""I didn't do this"". ""This looks bad"". ""Not my problem"". ""This isn't related really to my fix, but someone way over there made a mistake"". ""I hate this (loop this sentence 10 times a day)"", ""I can't fix this, get the person who made this code to fix it"". The person who coded that mistake has moved on, when will you? 7) The dictator: My way or the highway is their motto. It's their ""ideas"" vs ""your ideas"", not ""project ideas"". It's their solution vs your solution. I bet there will be an argument for sure. Somehow they will keep coming back to a part of code that you implemented. It somehow discomforts them even if it works, tests, and looks perfectly fine. This person is a big bottleneck to productivity and will be the first person to crumble under pressure and start pointing fingers. This person is not good for the team, however experienced/good a developer he may be. 8) The overcautious: The Java developer who just froze when he learned that he would have to write a Python script. The developer who panicked on learning that something in the registry needs changing. The developer who cringes at having to input things in the database. These people will do anything to avoid getting out of their comfort zone. They have weird superstitions related to having to touch certain parts of the system. I have learned, from personal experience, that this phenomenon is common with new developers. Good developers show a tendency to slowly/swiftly move out of their comfort zone in exploration. 9) The careless: Forgets to take a backup, snapshots, has multiple working directories of code, leaves system out, prints in production code, etc. Again, this is a newbie tendency and gets better with more professional exposure. 10) The lazy pseudo-hacker: They pride themselves at being able to trick the system into working. They find magical solutions to seemingly complex problems. My experience says that 9 out of 10 times, it's just a facade.

""i hate this loop this sentence 10 times a day"", ""i can't fix this, get the person who made this code to fix it"". the person who coded that mistake has moved on, when will you? 7 the dictator: my way or the highway is their motto. it's their ""ideas"" vs ""your ideas"", not ""project ideas"". it's their solution vs your solution. i bet there will be an argument for sure. somehow they will keep coming back to a part of code that you implemented. it somehow discomforts them even if it works, tests, and looks perfectly fine. this person is a big bottleneck to productivity and will be the first person to crumble under pressure and start pointing fingers. this person is not good for the team, however experiencedgood a developer he may be. 8 the overcautious: the java developer who just froze when he learned that he would have to write a python script. the developer who panicked on learning that something in the registry needs changing. the developer who cringes at having to input things in the database. these people will do anything to avoid getting out of their comfort zone. they have weird superstitions related to having to touch certain parts of the system. i have learned, from personal experience, that this phenomenon is common with new developers. good developers show a tendency to slowlyswiftly move out of their comfort zone in exploration. 9 the careless: forgets to take a backup, snapshots, has multiple working directories of code, leaves system out, prints in production code, etc. again, this is a newbie tendency and gets better with more professional exposure. 10 the lazy pseudo-hacker: they pride themselves at being able to trick the system into working. they find magical solutions to seemingly complex problems. my experience says that 9 out of 10 times, it's just a facade. the hack is bad and will crash sooner or later and will cost much more than having to deal with it, with extra time right now.",-15,too_long,"found this interesting post on quora, which was also published in forbes",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,6,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,12,2,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,74,74

As I am sure many developers and hiring managers in the tech industry are noticing, the job market is getting more competitive by the day and it isn’t country-specific.

arundhati-banerjee-130912a0,"What differentiates SAP Labs from its competitors is the care it takes of its employees. The very existence of Diversity & Inclusion Team is a testament to SAP’s commitment in creating and maintaining a great place to work! Keeping the ethos of SAP in mind, the Diversity & Inclusion arm of SAP Labs India (D&I, India) designed and executed the Cross Generational Mentorship Program , which presented the T1 community across all entities (Labs, Ariba, SDC, Concur, Success factors, Fieldglass) and locations (Bangalore, Gurgaon, Pune, Mumbai) with an opportunity to reverse mentor senior colleagues and get mentored by them. The intent was to bridge the gap between the senior and junior colleagues so that both equally benefit from insightful conversations across various domains. Indeed, it was all about breaking biases and fostering, and deepening the learning curve and productivity that leads to success. It is often said that learning something new from a person from a completely different background does much more than developing skills. It makes us lower our prejudices, release preconceived biases, invoke our will, and work on personal network building. And that’s what happened in Cross Generational Mentorship, where the young talents had to reverse mentor senior colleagues and at the same time get mentored by them. The young talents and senior colleagues had different topics of interest, different perspectives, different mindsets, and more. Yet they were united by the third friend called Cross Generational Mentorship. The concept of Cross Generational Mentorship appeared exceptionally disruptive to both my mentor Ujjwal Nath, Development Manager - Globalization Services and me. Having a T1 reverse mentor for someone who is an accomplished force in the industry confounded me. In an industry where every second day is path-breaking, keeping up with the pace is imperative. It is programs like these that allow people like me to stay on top of an ever-changing ecosystem. While the program expands the horizon for senior members, it opens doors for junior colleagues as well. Truth is, if anyone has been in the industry for at least 6 months, she/he must have heard that networking is key. However, one wonders, how can a junior colleague network? Well, ETs do join in a group and form strong bonds with their peers, but a network is far more valuable when it is diverse. Therefore, Cross Generational Mentorship is the perfect springboard for a junior colleague to diversify her/his network. Besides the networking aspect, a T1 gets to pick on the best brains and learns to imbibe attributes that have made seasoned individuals successful. The current program was kickstarted by D&I Team through setting up the context for the program; they did so through an orientation program in which they invited both the T1s and the senior officials. The program had a special Breaking Gen Myth workshop along with roll out of topics and the new gamification approach, that makes it even more competitive this time, to all the participants. While the ETs chose topics that they would like to mentor on, senior officials chose topics, from the same pool, that they wished to be mentored on. Based on the topics selected, all the participants were paired into sub-groups, which mostly consisted of one senior official and one/two T1s. I was mapped with Ujjwal and successfully completed 7 sessions (both theoretical and hands-on) on multiple topics like Mobile & Social Media, The Generation Game, Career Aspiration Management, How to Climb Up the Ladder, Crowdsourcing Applications, Conversational AI, Cyber Security & Cyber Privacy and Data Boom. From different perspectives we talked, we discussed, we chatted, we debated, and yes, we learned. Ujjwal's coaching sessions paved a path for me on how to reach my short term and long-term goals and make it a reality, whereas my mentoring sessions inspired him to be an active contributor to D&I and had nominated this program to all other senior leaders. In short, it was a platform where lots of questions were asked and answered, lots of discussions happened, and finally resulted in great bonding. Overall, Cross Generational Mentorship not only made our branches reach for the skies but also made our roots go deep. Coming to the close of this blog, I am elated to be a part of something so refreshing. The more I invested in the program, the more I gained from it.

The release of Kimi K2.5 and Arcee’s Trinity Large introduced clever architectural ideas — from Agent Swarm Orchestration to Fine-grained MoEs.

sanchit-goyal14,"What is ONDC? It is an open protocol network to enable local commerce across segments by engaging with any network-enabled application. In simple words, suppose you want to order milk from the local Kirana shop which accepts Paytm. Now, you can go to the ONDC platform and directly order from this Kirana shop network. Dunzo might deliver your order and you can pay through Paytm. Different platforms like Paytm, Dunzo, Sellerapp, Gofrugal, etc. need to integrate their application with ONDC. There are many other important players with whom talks are going on, like Google Pay, Phone Pe, Microsoft, Zoho, BHIM, etc. Data Points 4000 + small and big e-commerce companies 500 + logistics companies 20,000 + providing services through e-commerce platforms $200 billion estimated market size of e-commerce by 2026 TAM - 624 million Internet users in India SAM - 478 million ( 76.7% e-commerce penetration) SOM - 100 million ( 80-100 million current e-commerce users who have made at least one purchase and assuming 10% increase due to ONDC) Average Order value for grocery - $21 in 2017 AOV for physical goods - Rs 3600 ($48) in 2016 Market Potential - $2.1 billion for grocery alone and $4.8 billion for physical goods However, if we consider the increment of e-commerce users by 20% due to ONDC push then SOM will be 120 million and market potential for physical goods would reach $5.7 billion. Considering 7% of inflation too for AOV, this number would be easily $8 billion in 2022. I have only considered the B2C physical goods market to reach $8 billion. There is a huge B2B market too and then many other categories in B2C too. Features of ONDC Merchants will be able to reach more consumers Both offline traders and online platforms will come at the same level in terms of digital exposure All transactions will happen through an open platform Operations will be standardized and logistics will become more efficient Higher value for consumers as they can order from any merchant The biggest concern about ONDC is confidentiality and privacy of data which needs to be taken care of by the GoI. Pilot Cities The pilot will be launched in five cities in the initial phase. For launching the pilot, metro and Tier 2 cities have been chosen to see how the technology works. Delhi Bengaluru Bhopal Shillong Coimbatore Value Proposition Merchants : No need to worry about logistics and supply chain, just need to make the catalog available digitally to have visibility for everyone connected to the Internet. Consumers : Convenience in ordering from any merchant they want. Applications : More orders for last-mile logistics partners; offline payments shifting to online payments thus benefiting payment partners too. Government of India : Higher employment opportunities; equal digital presence of offline and online traders; all stakeholders on a common platform so easy to monitor; opportunity for village-level merchants and entrepreneurs. Difference in ONDC vs E-commerce players The major difference between the two is that the merchant and the customer can collaborate together irrespective of how one is present digitally. For example, a merchant might not be listed on any platform like Amazon, Flipkart or Dunzo but still can avail the services of Dunzo to send grocery to the customer. In fact, it is possible that the merchant have never availed the services of any digital platform. Another difference is that while ordering from e-commerce players, everything needs to happen on their platform. But using ONDC, offline merchants can easily offer their own forms of support and just use digital platforms for transactions and logistics. Summing Up The ONDC platform is much easy to use. Vendors can onboard easily. There is cost transparency. It will demolish the monopoly of the big e-commerce players who play by their own terms. They give all the facilities to customers but sometimes ignore their sellers. ONDC will bring all the merchants at the same level and will give more value to the customers by increasing the number of listings for them. In case you liked this piece, give a thumbs up.

testerops,"One of the most important professional qualities that you can have today is the ability to woo the target audience like investors, your team members with a perfect presentation. A nice and well prepared presentation along with killer presentation skills will make your work a lot easier in many scenarios. I am always looking to hone my presentation skills and like to work on it at any point of day. So I always keep on looking for nice articles and people's suggestion on key points which needs to focused more while presenting. And believe me, from a shy person, wary of giving a simple presentation, I have transformed into a confident person, who is not afraid of speaking in front of an audience today. Yesterday, I was browsing Quora, and I found a perfect answer given by Balaji Vishwanathan , on understanding how you would hone your presentation skills. If you go through the answer, he has given a proper, detailed analysis of how to approach and deliver a kick-ass presentation. Before the preparation Who: Understand the target. What does an average person sitting in the auditorium look like? Feel them, imagine them, draw them. What level of competency do they have in the subject you are going to present? Tailor the content to your audience. Never try to go over their heads or beneath their feet. Once you start visualizing the audience and get them into their heads, you can make an emotional bond with them. Why: Understand your motive. Why are you presenting? What are you planning to achieve after the presentation? Is it to attract investors? Is it to convince a scientific audience about the validity of your work? The presentation is just the marketing of your content and cannot be a replacement for your main content (a detailed deck & metrics in case of fund raising & a paper in case of a research presentation). The presentation is one of the weapons that should lead you to that strategic objective. What: Understand the context. What is the broad context of your presentation. Is it a part of a demo day? Is it part of an academic conference? Is it a company meeting? Is it a fund raising event for a charity? Is it a product demo? The context should drive your content and intent. Understand the Bikini rule of life - Reveal enough and conceal enough to spark interest. Most of us have the temptation to dump all the stuff we got into the poor little Powerpoint. That leads to intimidation and confusion. The goal of the presentation should be to spark that interest in your work so that your target comes towards you. In essence it is a conversation starter by gaining their attention. The Marketing Mindset When you are presenting, you are actually marketing [to eventually lead to a ""sale"" - of whatever you are attempting]. Get into that mindset. You can never sell someone an important idea through a single shot. You need go through a series of stages in the process of them buying your idea. First get them to be aware of your product, generate an interest and eventually lead them to process that leads them to ""purchase"". Your presentation should do the first two stages below. Preparing for your presentation The powerpoint deck is not a handout . Don't be that guy handing out irrelevant printouts of your powerpoint. Prepare a document handout prepared through a document creator like MS Word or InDesign. The powerpoint deck should not be a readable one . Certainly not a printable one. [If they are reading, they are not listening to you]. It should be to connect. To get your audience to be interested in you. No more than 7-10 words. Once the audience like your idea, they should have the handout to read more and then come to you for a much detailed walk through. Prepare a script. Powerpoint deck is not your cheatsheet to read from. Don't rest on that. Have a strong script and use the projection to complement what you say. When you have finished rehearsing, rehearse hard. Whenever I present without rehearsing, the result shows immediately in the audience [boredom]. Get to the empty stage. Before an important presentation, get to the stage when the whole place is empty. Pace the stage and let the physical world consume you. Feel at home and let the environment absorb you. Do a dry run. During one of my recent presentations, I didn't do a tech dry run. Not surprisingly the tech melted down and there was precious minutes lost. Make sure the technology doesn't fail you. Be very comfortable with the clothes you are going to wear. You should feel those clothes are an extension of your body. I have a favorite suit I bought 7 years ago and I don't wear any of my other suits for the most important presentations. I take it ceremonially and feel like a knight in his armor. That suit provides the cloak of invincibility. Once I'm in, I feel all the good omens from the past presentations come in and push me and give the confidence. When I'm in my favorite suit, I feel I can convince anyone in the world. During the presentation Have a good look at the audience and your preparation should have made you feel very close to that target. After you get to the stage and have setup your mike, don't start talking immediately. Pause a couple of seconds taking a good strong look with a strong smile [you can see that great leaders always do that before they start their speech]. That is when you are conveying you can be trusted. That brief 2-3 seconds can be very crucial. Disarm and charm the audience with mild self-deprecation . Get your first joke on yourself. Let the audience laugh. While I was once presenting to a group of rich southerners in Nashville, I made fun of my accent. The audience were smiling the whole time as I turned by weakness into an advantage [they were more attentive due to my accent, after that point]. I opened with this slide on 2 different occassions [both very important] and on both occassions, the audience burst out laughing & remembered the presentation. A designer friend crafted this deck for me. Don't turn your back on the audience and look to move a bit. A body language expert once coached on the right way to move & make the audience trust. Coming forward conveys trust. So, when you are conveying your big idea or getting to the ask, move a few inches forward. That little movement forward can send a lot of subtle cues. Going back can send messages of dishonestly. Thus, avoid moving back [unless you are taking a joke on you] and always make a small movement forward - and make that movement so subtle that the audience doesn't even know you are walking towards them. Also avoid showing the back of your hand or the back of the body - those all increases distrust. Master your pauses. This is the hardest thing to do for non-professionals. Masters of drama know when to pause to give that impact. After your big idea got to the screen, wait a second or two to give that dramatic effect. Let the audience absorb the drama. Keep your basics correct - making eye contact with a chunk of the audience, changing your tones a bit. As a parting note, give the presentation its due importance. Give the audience their due respect. A presentation can change your whole life. Thus, take it seriously and do the homework.",6.0,0.0,4043,,12279,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],7214,7194,1281,1277,102,11,0,0,"one of the most important professional qualities that you can have today is the ability to woo the target audience like investors, your team members with a perfect presentation. a nice and well prepared presentation along with killer presentation skills will make your work a lot easier in many scenarios. i am always looking to hone my presentation skills and like to work on it at any point of day. so i always keep on looking for nice articles and people's suggestion on key points which needs to focused more while presenting. and believe me, from a shy person, wary of giving a simple presentation, i have transformed into a confident person, who is not afraid of speaking in front of an audience today. yesterday, i was browsing quora, and i found a perfect answer given by balaji vishwanathan , on understanding how you would hone your presentation skills. if you go through the answer, he has given a proper, detailed analysis of how to approach and deliver a kick-ass presentation. before the preparation who: understand the target. what does an average person sitting in the auditorium look like? feel them, imagine them, draw them. what level of competency do they have in the subject you are going to present? tailor the content to your audience. never try to go over their heads or beneath their feet. once you start visualizing the audience and get them into their heads, you can make an emotional bond with them. why: understand your motive. why are you presenting? what are you planning to achieve after the presentation? is it to attract investors? is it to convince a scientific audience about the validity of your work? the presentation is just the marketing of your content and cannot be a replacement for your main content a detailed deck  metrics in case of fund raising  a paper in case of a research presentation. the presentation is one of the weapons that should lead you to that strategic objective. what: understand the context. what is the broad context of your presentation. is it a part of a demo day? is it part of an academic conference? is it a company meeting? is it a fund raising event for a charity? is it a product demo? the context should drive your content and intent. understand the bikini rule of life -

amitandani,"Recently, completing the NeuroLeadership Institute's ""Team: The Neuroscience of Psychological Safety"" course powerfully reaffirmed a critical truth for leaders: Psychological safety isn't merely a ""soft skill"" - it's a definitive strategic advantage. High-performing teams don't just avoid conflict; they thrive because leaders deliberately cultivate an environment where everyone feels secure enough to speak up, challenge norms, experiment, and learn openly. This is the true genesis of innovation. Fundamentally, psychological safety empowers teams to: ➤ Share diverse perspectives without hesitation. ➤ Challenge assumptions, sparking new ideas. ➤ View mistakes as invaluable learning opportunities. ➤ Contribute confidently, regardless of communication style. As leaders, our actions set the precedent. Our behavior directly dictates whether our teams feel empowered to think boldly or constrained by hesitation. Three Leadership Habits Driving Psychological Safety: ✅ 1 - Set the Stage - Clarity & Shared Purpose ➤ Define ""Us"": Establish team identity and collective purpose. ➤ Frame Impact: Articulate the significance and value of our work. ➤ Proactive Planning: Anticipate and prepare for challenges effectively. ✅ 2 - Invite Participation - Amplify Every Voice ➤ Lead with Humility: Demonstrate an openness to not having all answers. ➤ Streamline Input: Provide diverse, easy channels for contribution. ➤ Spark Curiosity: Actively encourage fresh perspectives and exploration. ✅ 3 - Respond Thoughtfully - Reinforce Openness ➤ Validate Contributions: Acknowledge and affirm inputs to build confidence. ➤ Cultivate Constructive Debate: Normalize respectful challenges and disagreements. ➤ Drive Forward Thinking: Elevate ideas to uncover breakthrough innovations. Consistent application of these habits builds teams that collaborate with unwavering confidence and innovate with genuine courage.

The 21st century is so called ‘the Information age’ but for how long? Would it become just like other careers due to the saturation and then we will ‘invent’ another career? Many people get MBAs hoping to get into executive roles but many end up doing normal accounting, finance, banking or marketing. Some like to pursue performing arts, while others like liberal arts. The point is, there are too many career choices, don’t limit yourself, look around, find what you truly like and believe in, and then pursue it with passion and dedication, but do not just follow the crowd. IT seems to be one of the major career choices for many these days but IT is not just writing computer programs. It is like medical field, too many options to choose from. Not everyone is and should be a technical person. Computer is not just about writing programs, it is much more than that. There are many areas in IT like thought leadership, sales, marketing, animations, graphics, games, hardware, software and many more to choose from. Don’t get confused by the buzz words like ‘cloud’, ‘big data’, and the like. As long as you know the basic principles, everything remains the same. Just because you are studying computers and don’t like programming and are not good at it, it does not belittle you in anyway.

tripti-srivastava-28958416a,"Ever wondered why PINK screams ""girl power"" everywhere? Did we girls/women pick it, or did someone hand it to us on a pink platter? This question's been buzzing in my head for years, looking at gender reveal parties (blue balloons for boys, pink for girls), family baby showers drowning in pink gifts, and ads pushing the vibe. Fun fact from history though: Back in the early 1900s, pink was for boys (think fiery red vibes), blue for girls. But mid-20th century marketers flipped the script with clever campaigns, store guides, and Barbie dolls, making pink the girl color. Baby girls get pink dreamcatchers, frocks, and toys from day one! it's the world serving it up, not always our choice! (Not Mine atleast). Here we are in 2026, and it's still the same old tune: Relatives popping blue/pink balloons for newborns (rainbow gets ignored), funny-not-funny videos of dads sulking over Barbie bags vs cheerful with video games (""Dude, let her pick: FIFA or dolls?""), and few nonprofits (sorry but not sorry!) slapping ""Pink"" on everything women-related. Pink Toilets? Government! Really? (The ladies' sign works fine!) I was introduced to PS5, Hot Wheels, punching bags, and COD pretty late by my male cousins, friends, and husband, but now I absolutely love them! And boys can love pink too! Again, it's 2026 and STILL! Not starting a fight, just sharing a lightbulb moment. Am I solo in my circle on this? Your thoughts?

testerops,"Here is an excellent post I found on Quora, posted by Oliver Emberton. Our brains are the most bug ridden pieces of junk since Internet Explorer. To replicate one common bug, try telling your brain to “go to the gym”. Most brains will respond by updating their Facebook status, and watching cat videos. This is not the desired behaviour. Fortunately I’ve developed a fix. Let me just explain how the whole human brain works first. This code is a mess Looking at our brain, it’s clear it was developed by a team of ten thousand monkeys with a serious drinking problem. You know, like Windows 8. The brain is event-driven , which is to say it does almost nothing until an event occurs, and then it responds to the event. Your hand gets hot, you pull it back. Your stomach rumbles, you look for food. Unfortunately there are a lot of events. There are events for shiny objects coming into view, or for scary monsters, or for boobs – actually, there are 856 different events for boobs, but I digress – and all of these events are firing in our brain and competing for our limited processing ability. Too late the developers realised this would leave us bouncing between distractions like a cat chasing a laser pointer, and they hacked in a priority system. Unfortunately, our priority system is a bit pants: the default priority for sitting down is higher than the priority for working out. But wait! We’re smarter than – ooh, a squirrel Don’t we have some kind of clever, conscious brain though? The part that does math and plays chess and copies Sally’s homework? Well, yes. But that part is event driven too, which is to say it’s not on all the time. It turns out our brains were optimised for energy efficiency, and they only turn on their CPU (Consciousness Processing Unit) when absolutely necessary. If you’ve ever realised you’ve been driving for an hour and hadn’t even noticed, that was your consciousness going into Standby Mode. It’s your consciousness that tells you to exercise, even if you don’t want to, because it can see the long term benefits are greater than the short term pain. And when it’s in control, you do so. But consciousness demands a lot of power. When your mental battery is low, it’s easily overpowered out by higher priorities, like playing Hearthstone or squeezing a particularly awkward spot. The bug fix We’re going to add a new event of our own to fix things. Non-programmers might call this a ‘habit’. Our new event is triggered by a transition . For example, if you wake up, that’s a transition. Arrive at your desk – that’s a transition. Arrive home – that’s a transition. It’s at the transition that our behaviour is most likely to be hijacked by the highest priority event that happens to be in our brain at the time. If you’ve arrived home, chances are that event is “I’m knackered” and you’ll fall onto the sofa. We need to stop that. Don’t worry if you’re not fluent in Brain Programming (B#) – just remember three words: “No. Right. Now.” Let’s break it down: “No” Firstly, we need to interrupt all other events. There’s a trick for overpowering mental distractions, and that’s to make your intention insanely simple . No is about as simple an intention as you can get. No means simply reject everything . If you want to check Facebook, the answer is no. If someone is asking you if you have 5 minutes, the answer is no. If this will piss someone off, it’s still no. Don’t complicate this with exceptions. Exceptions will happen anyway – if your house is on fire, primal instincts will take over. But 99.9% of the time, in our comfortable modern lives, the greatest danger to you is that you live by your outdated survival impulses. Start by saying no to everything. You might worry that by declining everyone and everything you’ll become some kind of sociopathic robot. You’ll still have time for those distractions later. Tell people that . The trick is to get done what matters first . “Right” Now ask yourself what is the one ‘right’ thing you should be doing now. I did not say three things . There can be only one. You shouldn’t need to think about this much, because your conscious brain should already have decided for you the night before: it’s usually the one thing you want to do all the time, but never find time for. A crucial distinction here is importance versus urgency . The most important things in life – like eating healthy – are rarely urgent. And our brain’s buggy events are great at dealing with urgent things – like the phone ringing – all by themselves. So when given the choice, choose importance over urgency . It makes the most difference in the long run. “Now” Start doing the right thing immediately. Not after you’ve checked your email – immediately . Don’t give yourself time to even think about it , just start . Starting is always the hardest part; the very inertia which makes something hard to start can make it equally hard to stop. This simple fix works because when you transition from one place to another, your brain is unusually receptive to events. It needs to decide on a new course of action, and once it chooses one it tends to stick to it. Unfortunately we tend to make stupid decisions at transitions, because we don’t think about them: Interrupt your transitions with the right choices, and you’ll find yourself doing what matters far, far more often: Just remember: “No. Right. Now.” Three short words to program a life changing habit.

the part that does math and plays chess and copies sallys homework? well, yes. but that part is event driven too, which is to say its not on all the time. it turns out our brains were optimised for energy efficiency, and they only turn on their cpu consciousness processing unit when absolutely necessary. if youve ever realised youve been driving for an hour and hadnt even noticed, that was your consciousness going into standby mode. its your consciousness that tells you to exercise, even if you dont want to, because it can see the long term benefits are greater than the short term pain. and when its in control, you do so. but consciousness demands a lot of power. when your mental battery is low, its easily overpowered out by higher priorities, like playing hearthstone or squeezing a particularly awkward spot. the bug fix were going to add a new event of our own to fix things. non-programmers might call this a habit. our new event is triggered by a transition . for example, if you wake up, thats a transition. arrive at your desk  thats a transition. arrive home  thats a transition. its at the transition that our behaviour is most likely to be hijacked by the highest priority event that happens to be in our brain at the time. if youve arrived home, chances are that event is im knackered and youll fall onto the sofa. we need to stop that. dont worry if youre not fluent in brain programming b#  just remember three words: no. right. now. lets break it down: no firstly, we need to interrupt all other events. theres a trick for overpowering mental distractions, and thats to make your intention insanely simple . no is about as simple an intention as you can get. no means simply reject everything . if you want to check facebook, the answer is no. if someone is asking you if you have 5 minutes, the answer is no. if this will piss someone off, its still no. dont complicate this with exceptions. exceptions will happen anyway  if your house is on fire, primal instincts will take over. but 99.9 of the time, in our comfortable modern lives, the greatest danger to you is that you live by your outdated survival impulses. start by saying no to everything. you might worry that by declining everyone and everything youll become some kind of sociopathic robot. youll still have time for those distractions later. tell people that . the trick is to get done what matters first . right now ask yourself what is the one right thing you should be doing now. i did not say three things . there can be only one. you shouldnt need to think about this much, because your conscious brain should already have decided for you the night before: its usually the one thing you want to do all the time, but never find time for. a crucial distinction here is importance versus urgency . the most important things in life  like eating healthy  are rarely urgent. and our brains buggy events are great at dealing with urgent things  like the phone ringing  all by themselves. so when given the choice, choose importance over urgency . it makes the most difference in the long run. now start doing the right thing immediately. not after youve checked your email  immediately . dont give yourself time to even think about it , just start . starting is always the hardest part; the very inertia which makes something hard to start can make it equally hard to stop. this simple fix works because when you transition from one place to another, your brain is unusually receptive to events. it needs to decide on a new course of action, and once it chooses one it tends to stick to it. unfortunately we tend to make stupid decisions at transitions, because we dont think about them: interrupt your transitions with the right choices, and youll find yourself doing what matters far, far more often: just remember: no. right. now. three short words to program a life changing habit. here is the link to the complete answer- with awesome images : url",-15,too_long,"here is an excellent post i found on quora, posted by oliver emberton",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,5,27,0,0,0,0,0,-18,5,7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,51

But what if agents could genuinely learn and improve over time? I've been exploring a continual learning framework built on a simple but powerful loop: ACT → RECORD → REFLECT → LEARN The agent doesn't just complete tasks—it captures every action, analyzes its own performance, and extracts reusable knowledge. This happens through three distinct learning mechanisms: 1. Memory Learning The agent remembers facts, user preferences, and behavioral patterns. No more repeating yourself across sessions. 2. Prompt Optimization Through self-reflection, the agent identifies what worked and refines its own instructions. It literally rewrites how it thinks. 3. Skill Creation Successful multi-step workflows get extracted into reusable skills (SOPs). What once required step-by-step guidance becomes a single command. The key insight: learning isn't a separate training phase. It's woven into the operational loop. Every interaction is an opportunity to improve. This mirrors how humans develop expertise—through deliberate practice and reflection, not just repetition. The gap between ""AI assistant"" and ""AI colleague"" isn't more parameters.

abidalee,"For last several months I have seen these and similar hashtags, never in my wildest imaginations I had thought that I would be using them myself. I read many stories over the months, some based on science, others based on conspiracy theories. The former I found to be useful and full of hope, and the later, full of ignorance. I say this because of my first-hand experience with #covid19. The year 2020 ended with bad news for our family, my father was tested positive on December 31st. The year 2021 brought another bad news, i.e. my mother was tested positive on Jan 1st (followed by several of my siblings getting the virus). We were hopeful because both my parents (and the entire family) were fighting it. The battle started at home, moved quickly to the hospital, and within a few days we lost our dear mother yesterday to this deadly disease. It is hard to believe that just a few days ago I was speaking with her on the phone, and she was full of life and hope, and now she is not among us. She was a very strong woman and fought till the last minute. She was fully determined to beat it but unfortunately she lost the battle and the virus took her life. All the recent and advanced medications couldn’t save her. My father and other family members are recuperating and we as a family continue to fight this battle (hence need all the prayers). I wanted to take a moment and remind everyone that please do not listen to the ignorant people who think of #covid19 as a hoax. It is a deadly disease, from speaking with my mother on phone a few days ago to seeing her losing her battle just in a matter of days proves one thing to me that this disease is NOT a joke, and it is not going anywhere until it has done enough damage. You need to protect yourself and your loved ones. The easiest thing is to ‘wear a mask!’. I also want to mention that we often focus on the patients and forget the caretakers, who are the #realheroes, and by caretakers, I don’t mean the medical professionals (yes they are indeed heroes), but I mean the family members, who are fighting the battle alongside their loved ones. My mother has always been my hero and source of strength and inspiration, but today, my even a bigger hero is #Neelum, our little sister, who did not give up till the last minute, who was rushing from ward to ward, pharmacy to pharmacy, 24x7, without any sleep or even caring for her own health.

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"The biggest pain point or challenge I hear when people are writing their resume is that they want concise, crisp, effective content that sounds impactful. But they’re not sure how to write that wonderful content they want. There is so much to consider when thinking about your content. There are many different traits you want to showcase on your resume that the business values for any given position. There is much more to a successful data science hire than just technical and machine learning ability, and we’ll want to think about how to best position these skills as well. Here are some quick examples of how you can up-level the content on your resume to get you started. Here we’re going to cover: Starting with a verb Ending with the value you provided STARTING WITH A VERB Strong statements start with an action verb. A short list of some verbs that you can try to apply to your experience include: Built Delivered Developed Increased efficiency Created Evaluated Trained Try to vary your verbs as well. Don’t use the same one over and over again throughout your resume. So we have some words, let’s look at some real examples from resumes and how the statements improve by starting with a verb. This first example comes from a math teacher who is learning data science through MOOCs and is planning to make a career change. Original: “I ran live lessons on Blackboard Collaborate and attended meetings via the computer.” Updated: “Presented math training virtually, delivered mathematical concepts in a way that students could easily comprehend and learn.” This shows that she is able to break down material and communicate well. The following would also work: Updated (another version): “Conducted virtual meetings with expert communication. Provided students the ability to receive one-on-one guidance to keep them on pace in a way that fit their schedule.” The next example is from a BI professional who is also looking to make a move to data science: Original: “Participation in Global Transformation Program as Commercial Finance Business Intelligence (BI) expert (Credit and Collections), in the definition of KPIs and Global template Reports. Testing, Business Readiness and Post Go live support for Ecuador implementation (Releases 1, 2 and 3). Support to front office area (sales and distribution).” Here, our example owned the definition of KPIs and reporting. She also contributed cross-functionally to help make this project a success. Talking about ownership of KPIs, and being a strong contributor cross-functionally sounds stronger when we begin with a verb instead of “participation” (noun). Updated: “Owned definition of KPIs and reporting, ensuring accuracy and allowing for self-service of key metrics by stakeholders.” I’d certainly need to create more bullet points to capture all of the information in the original, but this is an idea of what we’re trying to achieve. ENDING YOUR STATEMENTS WITH THE RESULT OR VALUE Let’s look at an opportunity for improvement that was on my resume for a while. Original: “ Built Neural Network models to forecast hourly electric load.” Cool story, but did I just build it for fun? Or was it useful? Especially in a space where businesses are all too familiar with someone building a fancy model, and then it never gets used for anything, it is of utmost importance that you clearly demonstrate how your work was utilized. Spell. it. out. Updated: “Built Neural Network models to forecast hourly electric load. Model output was imperative during extreme weather and was used for capacity planning decisions.” Now I have a statement that shows not only that I delivered a model, but that model delivered value to the business. Maybe your previous work experience doesn’t involve building a model. Maybe you built a dashboard. Did that dashboard allow your stakeholders to get valuable information on their own (referred to as self-service)? That’s value. Did the dashboard reduce the amount of time spent on ad-hoc, low value data aggregation so you could focus on higher value initiatives? That’s value, because here you’re increasing efficiency. In my resume course I go into much deeper detail, but I hope this gives you a great starting point on how to begin creating strong content. Using verbs as your starting point and demonstrating the value your work provided is a great step towards marketing yourself and showcasing your talents.

stephenthomashiggins,"Thinking about vibe coding your own version of HubSpot? Here’s why it might be a good idea. You’re technical. You’re efficient. AI can scaffold a clean CRM in a weekend. No bloat. No subscription fees. Fully customized to your motion. On the surface, it makes sense. Until you remember: a CRM isn’t a database with stages. It’s your: • System of record • Forecasting engine • Revenue governance layer • Attribution model • Automation hub • Integration spine • Compliance surface And it has to work at scale. Vibe coding works when the blast radius is small — internal tools, workflow prototypes, lightweight automation, reporting overlays. If it breaks, nothing fundamental breaks. A CRM is different. The failure cost compounds over time: • Data integrity degrades. • Forecast accuracy erodes. • Integrations become technical debt. • Security and permissions become your problem. • Adoption becomes a behavioral battle. Most homegrown CRMs don’t fail immediately. They fail at scale. And here’s the real issue: opportunity cost. If you’re a founder or revenue leader, your leverage isn’t writing CRUD logic. It’s improving win rates, cycle time, ACV, talent density, and forecast precision. Every hour spent maintaining infrastructure is an hour not spent increasing revenue throughput. Platforms like HubSpot outperform custom builds not because they’re perfect — but because they compound: • Institutionalized GTM best practices • Reliability under scale • Deep integrations • Continuous iteration without engineering lift • Board-level credibility in forecasting The trap is ego disguised as efficiency: “We can build it cleaner.” Maybe.

ybernstein,"One of the things that excites me about working in technology is the subtle but deep interplay between technology, product, and market. Making the right decision on a matter as seemingly technical as how to set up indexes on a database table requires an understanding of how the product is used, and what the key drivers of the business are. What are the most common patterns of access to the data going to be? Which queries sit behind latency-sensitive conversion drivers and must be optimised at any expense? And so on. At the same time, product and business decisions cannot be made well without meaningful technical input. A particular product decision might be really easy to implement, or it might be very hard. Is doubling the number of events being logged simply a matter of adding a couple of lines of code? Or does it involve refactoring a complex module to remove a performance bottleneck? In the latter case, perhaps a simple workaround (shard to two different logs) would obviate the need for a huge amount of work. Software development is an endless series of decisions and tradeoffs, large and small. Attempting to centralise this decision-making with product management or engineering leadership results in disastrous micromanagement. Most likely, many of the decisions are taken by developers anyway---but without the necessary context and thus suboptimally. The only way to build great products is to empower developers to act like product owners. What does this mean? At the most basic level this requires that developers have a good understanding of the product they are building. Software development takes place within a broader context. If you deny software developers the context they need to make good technical decisions, the result will be much like an historical novel written by somebody with no knowledge of the relevant period in history; perhaps satisfactory in superficial form, but filled with incorrect details and misapprehensions. It is imperative that developers are both expected and afforded the opportunity to understand their users and customers---and indeed to think of them as their users and customers. Beyond understanding, a true developer-as-product-owner mentality means constructively questioning the product and making suggestions about how the product (as opposed to just the software) could be built. As a technical leader, I often see myself as the yin to a Product Manager's yang. Both of us are in a sense paid to think about how to build a good product; but whereas the PMs job is to think expansively and creatively about what could be, the technical lead's job is to keep that vision of the future grounded to realities of technology and limited resources. But I hate being a bottleneck, so a much better way of scaling this dynamic is for all developers to take this approach. At Google, one of the dimensions along which a developer's performance was measured was the impact of their work. When this new rubric was first introduced, I was quite unhappy with it. I even wrote a long internal blog post called ""impact considered harmful"" that argued it was unfair to judge a developer's performance based on something that was in many cases beyond their control. As time passed, though, I realised that having impact as part of my job description was actually very empowering. If I'm required to optimise my impact, that means that all sorts of things are now part of my job!

stephaniehillsphd,"You don’t need more credentials. You need more clarity . That’s what actually moves your career forward. 🚀 When I first started my business, I felt completely stuck. I was running the business, trying different things, juggling ideas—but I wasn’t making the kind of progress I wanted. I had the skills. The drive. But I was lacking clarity , direction , and momentum . That’s when I found Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill. I didn’t expect a book from 1937 to shift how I thought about my entire career. But it did. 🏁 And it started with Chapter 1— Desire . Maybe you're in that place right now. 💪 You’re ambitious. 💪 Smart. 💪 Capable. But...you’re second-guessing your next move. You’re not sure what the right role is—or if the one you're in is even aligned. 🚫 You’re busy, but not fulfilled. 🚫 Moving, but not advancing. And it’s not your fault . Most career advice tells you to follow the next shiny title, build your résumé, or chase whatever’s trending in the job market. You’re told to ""do more,"" “be realistic,” and “wait your turn.” But that’s the problem. 🚫 We’ve been trained to work harder… not to think deeper. 🚫 We’ve been taught to fit into a role… not to design a life. ⚡️ The moment I stopped asking what should I do? and started asking what do I truly desire? That’s when everything shifted. Not just in my business, but in how I showed up—in my energy, my confidence, and the kind of clients and opportunities I attracted. You don’t grow your career by doing more. You grow by getting clear on what you want. 🔥 Overview: The 13 Principles of Think and Grow Rich 🔥 Napoleon Hill studied hundreds of the most successful people of his time and distilled their success into 13 principles . This book isn’t just about money. It’s about becoming the kind of person who creates success intentionally—with clarity, purpose, and belief—for your life, career, and financial freedom. The 13 Steps to Riches (and your dream life) are Desire Faith Auto-Suggestion Specialized Knowledge Imagination Organized Planning Decision Persistence Power of the Mastermind The Mystery of Sex Transmutation The Subconscious Mind The Brain The Sixth Sense Each of these applies to your career journey , and I’ll be walking through all of them—one article at a time. 🏁 Let’s start at the foundation: Step 1: Desire – The Starting Point of Career Success 🔥 Hill calls Desire the starting point of all achievement—not hope, not wish, not luck. A burning desire. Crystal-clear, all-in, uncompromising. In your career, that means this: You have to know what you want before you can attract it, create it, or get promoted into it. Most people skip this part. They stay vague: “I just want something better.” But vague desires produce vague results. Hill outlines six steps to turn desire into results. Let’s expand on those and apply them directly to your career: ✅ 10 Career-Driven Ways to Apply Napoleon Hill’s Principle of Desire: 1️⃣ Get specific. What exactly do you want? Promotion? Pivot? Leadership role? Your own business? Name it. 2️⃣ Attach meaning to it. Why does this matter to you personally ? What would it change in your life? The moment you attach deep emotion to your vision—it becomes a MUST. And when it’s a MUST, your brain finds the way. 3️⃣ Decide what you’ll give in return. Time? Focus? Learning? Growth? This is about investment, not sacrifice. It is time to invest in yourself. To commit fully. 4️⃣ Set a target date. When will this happen? “Someday” is not a strategy. Imagine it was a year from now and you are looking back at the past year. 5️⃣ Create a career statement. “I will become a Director of Engineering by July 2025 and lead a high-impact global team.” I print mine out and put it on my vision board. Read it out loud daily. 6️⃣ Visualize it. See yourself doing the work. Feeling fulfilled. Living the life that aligns. Imagine the freedom it brings. 7️⃣ Write a simple plan. A roadmap that includes the next 3 actions you can take. Take daily massive imperfect action. 8️⃣ Cut the noise. Remove one obligation that doesn't align with your desire. Reclaim that energy. I like to call this my ""not to do"" list. What can you eliminate? 9️⃣ Surround yourself with belief. Join communities, follow leaders, and get mentors who reinforce what’s possible. Remember, you are who you surround yourself with. 🔟 Refuse to settle. Desire is only powerful when you back it with action and commitment—even when doubt shows up. 🚀 Desire isn’t just the first step in growing rich and having the career and life of your dreams— It’s the first step in becoming fully aligned. Ready for the next step? In the next article, I’ll break down Faith —what Hill calls the power behind your belief—and how to use it to power every career move with confidence. 🔥 Until then, don’t chase titles. Chase what sets you on fire. 🔥 ♻ Repost to encourage your network to inspire others. ➕ Follow me ( Stephanie Hills, Ph.D. ) for more like this. #freedomseekers #careerfreedom #leadershipdevelopment # leadershipdevelopment #worklifebalance #careeralignment #careerIlove #thinkandgrowrich #desire #dreamlife",4.0,0.0,330,,38166,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],31,11,"['🚀', '🏁', '💪', '💪', '💪', '🚫', '🚫', '🚫', '🚫', '⚡', '️', '🔥', '🔥', '🏁', '🔥', '✅', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '🔟', '🚀', '🔥', '🔥', '♻', '➕']",9,"['#freedomseekers', '#careerfreedom', '#leadershipdevelopment', '#worklifebalance', '#careeralignment', '#careerIlove', '#thinkandgrowrich', '#desire', '#dreamlife']",5104,4981,880,856,101,16,0,0,"you dont need more credentials. you need more clarity . thats what actually moves your career forward. when i first started my business, i felt completely stuck. i was running the business, trying different things, juggling ideasbut i wasnt making the kind of progress i wanted. i had the skills. the drive. but i was lacking clarity , direction , and momentum . thats when i found think and grow rich by napoleon hill. i didnt expect a book from 1937 to shift how i thought about my entire career. but it did. and it started with chapter 1 desire . maybe you're in that place right now. youre ambitious. smart. capable. but...youre second-guessing your next move. youre not sure what the right role isor if the one you're in is even aligned. youre busy, but not fulfilled. moving, but not advancing. and its not your fault . most career advice tells you to follow the next shiny title, build your rsum, or chase whatevers trending in the job market. youre told to ""do more,"" be realistic, and wait your turn. but thats the problem. weve been trained to work harder not to think deeper. weve been taught to fit into a role not to design a life. the moment i stopped asking what should i do?

dharmesh,"I've been experimenting with AI prompting techniques for years now (time flies!), and there's one useful technique that I'm genuinely surprised isn't more widely known. It's called ""meta prompting,"" and it's simple: you ask the AI (like ChatGPT or Claude) to rewrite your prompt and make it better, giving it permission to ask clarifying questions that will make the prompt more specific. This technique works so well that I actually built a tool around it: Metaprompt.com . (The tool used some of the recommended techniques by OpenAI and used in their free developer-focused tool). How Meta Prompting Works (And Why It's Almost Magical) Let's start with a definition. What is meta prompting? Meta prompting is the practice of writing instructions that guide how an AI should interpret and respond to prompts , rather than just what answer to give. In other words, it’s prompting about prompting—setting the rules, tone, or strategy the AI should use when generating responses. The concept behind Meta Prompting is simple but highly effective. Instead of struggling to write the perfect prompt yourself, you ask the AI to rewrite (optimize) your personally written prompt and make it better. You give it permission to ask any clarifying questions that will make the prompt more specific. You can do this manually with any system, but I found myself using this technique so often that I decided to build a dedicated tool for it: Metaprompt.com . Here’s how the tool works: Step 1: Write your initial prompt (even if it's rough or incomplete). I often start with a short sentence like ""Write a research report on HubSpot"". Step 2: Normally, you prompt the system to ask you questions about your prompt to make it more effective. Then it generates a series of questions for you to answer first. But if you use Metaprompt.com , the tool generates optimization questions for you automatically and presents them as simple checkboxes and dropdowns - no need to type lengthy responses. Step 3: Based on your selections, it creates an optimized prompt automatically, and you can either copy the optimized prompt, or run it with GPT-5 directly in the app. The difference in output quality when you use the tool is dramatic. A rough initial prompt gets you generic advice, while the optimized prompt gives the model far more context, getting you better responses with the right tone and specificity. What I love about turning this into a tool is that it makes meta prompting more accessible to anyone -- even to those just trying ChatGPT for the first time. No need to study prompting techniques or memorize frameworks, just click a few checkboxes and get better results immediately. It's a one-time investment, but a lifetime of value (if you use it for a prompt you use all the time). Why This Technique Deserves a Spot in Your AI Toolkit The whole craft of writing good prompts is known as prompt engineering, and it's been around for a while now. But most people find prompt engineering intimidating or overwhelming. Meta prompting solves that problem. It's a way for anyone -- even someone trying ChatGPT for the first time -- to immediately start getting better results without studying prompting techniques or memorizing frameworks. If you're a power user like me who interacts with AI multiple times per day, you won't always need to meta prompt because you develop an ""AI intuition"" for what works. But I do find myself using this technique often, especially when tackling something outside my usual use cases or I use a prompt frequently (as is the case when I'm writing prompts for an AI agent). What's particularly valuable is how meta prompting functions as a learning tool. By watching how AI systems restructure and improve your prompts, you naturally absorb what makes prompts more effective. You start noticing patterns: the importance of context, the power of specificity, the value of clear constraints and desired outcomes (more on all this later!). Over time, you'll find yourself writing better initial prompts because you've internalized these lessons. Happy prompting!",536.0,85.0,151,,1174428,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],4081,4060,677,677,39,1,3,0,"i've been experimenting with ai prompting techniques for years now time flies!, and there's one useful technique that i'm genuinely surprised isn't more widely known. it's called ""meta prompting,"" and it's simple: you ask the ai like chatgpt or claude to rewrite your prompt and make it better, giving it permission to ask clarifying questions that will make the prompt more specific. this technique works so well that i actually built a tool around it: metaprompt.com . the tool used some of the recommended techniques by openai and used in their free developer-focused tool. how meta prompting works and why it's almost magical let's start with a definition. what is meta prompting? meta prompting is the practice of writing instructions that guide how an ai should interpret and respond to prompts , rather than just what answer to give. in other words, its prompting about promptingsetting the rules, tone, or strategy the ai should use when generating responses. the concept behind meta prompting is simple but highly effective. instead of struggling to write the perfect prompt yourself, you ask the ai to rewrite optimize your personally written prompt and make it better. you give it permission to ask any clarifying questions that will make the prompt more specific. you can do this manually with any system, but i found myself using this technique so often that i decided to build a dedicated tool for it: metaprompt.com . heres how the tool works: step 1: write your initial prompt even if it's rough or incomplete. i often start with a short sentence like ""write a research report on hubspot"". step 2: normally, you prompt the system to ask you questions about your prompt to make it more effective. then it generates a series of questions for you to answer first. but if you use metaprompt.com , the tool generates optimization questions for you automatically and presents them as simple checkboxes and dropdowns - no need to type lengthy responses. step 3: based on your selections, it creates an optimized prompt automatically, and you can either copy the optimized prompt, or run it with gpt-5 directly in the app. the difference in output quality when you use the tool is dramatic. a rough initial prompt gets you generic advice, while the optimized prompt gives the model far more context, getting you better responses with the right tone and specificity. what i love about turning this into a tool is that it makes meta prompting more accessible to anyone -- even to those just trying chatgpt for the first time. no need to study prompting techniques or memorize frameworks, just click a few checkboxes and get better results immediately. it's a one-time investment, but a lifetime of value if you use it for a prompt you use all the time. why this technique deserves a spot in your ai toolkit the whole craft of writing good prompts is known as prompt engineering, and it's been around for a while now. but most people find prompt engineering intimidating or overwhelming. meta prompting solves that problem. it's a way for anyone -- even someone trying chatgpt for the first time -- to immediately start getting better results without studying prompting techniques or memorizing frameworks. if you're a power user like me who interacts with ai multiple times per day, you won't always need to meta prompt because you develop an ""ai intuition"" for what works. but i do find myself using this technique often, especially when tackling something outside my usual use cases or i use a prompt frequently as is the case when i'm writing prompts for an ai agent. what's particularly valuable is how meta prompting functions as a learning tool. by watching how ai systems restructure and improve your prompts, you naturally absorb what makes prompts more effective. you start noticing patterns: the importance of context, the power of specificity, the value of clear constraints and desired outcomes more on all this later!. over time, you'll find yourself writing better initial prompts because you've internalized these lessons. happy prompting!",-15,too_long,i've been experimenting with ai prompting techniques for years now time flies,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,3,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,51,51

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"Asking questions can sometimes seem scary. No one wants to appear “silly.” But I assure you: You’re not silly. It’s way more scary if you’re not asking questions. Data Science is a constant collaboration with the business and a series of questions and answers that allow you to deliver the analysis/model/data product that the business has in their head. Questions are required to fully understand what the business wants and not find yourself making assumptions about what others are thinking. Asking the right questions, like those you identified here is what separate Data Scientists that know ‘why’ from folks that only know what (tools and technologies). -Kayode Ayankoya We’re going to answer the following questions: Where do we ask questions? What are great questions? I had posted on LinkedIn recently about asking great questions in data science and received a ton of thought provoking comments. I will add a couple of my favorite comments/quotes throughout this article. WHERE DO WE ASK QUESTIONS? Basically every piece of the pipeline can be expressed as a question: And each of these questions could involve a plethora of follow up questions. To touch the tip of the iceberg, Kate Strachnyi posted a great assortment of questions that we typically ask (or want to consider) when scoping an analysis: Kate’s questions spanned both: Questions you’d ask stakeholders/different departments Questions you’d ask internally on the data science/analytics team. Any of the questions above could yield a variety of answers, so it is imperative that you’re asking questions. Just because you have something in your mind that is an awesome idea for approaching the problem, does not mean that other people don’t similarly have awesome ideas that need to be heard an discussed. At the end of the day, data science typically functions as a support function to other areas of the business. Meaning we can’t just go rogue. In addition to getting clarification and asking questions of stakeholders of the project, you’ll also want to collaborate and ask questions of those on your data science team. Even the most seasoned data scientist will still find themselves creating a methodology or solution that isn’t in their area of expertise or is a unique use case of an algorithm that would benefit from the thoughts of other data subject matter experts. Often times the person listening to your proposed methodology will just give you the thumbs up, but when you’ve been staring at your computer for hours there is also a chance that you haven’t considered one of the underlying assumptions of your model or you’re introducing bias somewhere. Someone with fresh eyes can give a new perspective and save you from realizing your error AFTER you’ve presented your results. Keeping your methodology a secret until you deliver the results will not do you any favors. If anything, sharing your thoughts upfront and asking for feedback will help to ensure a successful outcome. WHAT ARE GREAT QUESTIONS? Great questions are the ones that get asked. However, there is an art and science to asking good questions and also a learning process involved. Especially when you’re starting at a new job, ask everything. Even if it’s something that you believe you should already know, it’s better to ask and course-correct, than to not ask. You could potentially lose hours working on an analysis and then have your boss tell you that you misunderstood the request. It is helpful to also pose questions in a way that requires more than a “yes/no” response, so you can open up a dialogue and receive more context and information. How we formulate the questions is also very important. I’ve often found that people feel judged by my questions. I have to reassure them that all I want is to understand how they work and what are their needs and that my intention is not to judge them or criticize them. -Karlo Jimenez I’ve experienced what Karlo mentioned myself. Being direct can sometimes come off as judgement. We definitely need to put on our “business acumen” hats on to the best of our ability to come across as someone who is genuinely trying to understand and deliver to their needs. I’ve found that if I can pose the question as “looking for their valuable feedback”, it’s a win-win for everyone involved. As you build relationships with your team and stakeholders, this scenario is much less likely to occur. Once everyone realizes your personality and you’ve built a rapport, people will expect your line of questioning. Follow up questions, in its various forms, are absolutely critical. Probing gives you an opportunity to paraphrase the ask and gain consensus before moving forward. -Toby Baker Follow-up questions feel good. When a question prompts another question you feel like you’re really getting somewhere. Peeling back another layer of the onion if you will. You’re collaborating, you’re listening, you’re in the zone. IN SUMMARY The main takeaway here is that there are a TON of questions you need to ask to effectively produce something that the business wants. Once you start asking questions, it’ll become second nature and you’ll immediately see the value and find yourself asking even more questions as you gain more experience. Questioning has been instrumental to my career. An additional benefit is that I’ve found my ‘voice’ over the years. I feel heard in meetings and my opinion is valued. A lot of this growth has come from getting comfortable asking questions and I’ve also learned a ton about a given business/industry through asking these questions. I’ve learned a lot about diversity of viewpoints and that people express information in different ways. This falls under the “business acumen” piece of data science that we’re not often taught in school. But I hope you can go forward and fearlessly ask a whole bunch of questions.

ybernstein,"I'm just starting my fourth week at Flare , a two-year-old startup with about 30 people, after a ten year career at Google which, with north of 40,000 employees and a market cap of half a trillion dollars, is definitively not a startup. Flare is awesome, by the way. A great team, great business plan, lots of interesting challenges, and a real openness to all perspectives on the best way to achieve our goals. Anyway. As part of getting started I decided to share some early observations about the software development process at the company. One of my slides had this diagram: What I had observed was that every company is on a journey, and for every step on that journey there is a ""right"" amount of process to have in place. Good processes (e.g. documenting what you do, or having approval checklists for product launches) allow your organisation to operate at a larger scale, build higher-quality and more complex systems, reduce risk, and increase predictability. Well-considered and well-implemented processes support teams and individuals in doing their jobs. However, processes come at a cost in terms of raw productivity and throughput, and in the early stages of a startup many of them are too expensive to implement or are simply unnecessary. When you're two ramen-fuelled developers in a basement, the right amount of process is ""not much"". When you're a globe-straddling mega-corporation, the right amount of process is ""quite a lot"". And of course, when you're starting out then ""not much"" is a natural default. If you're growing, then, generally the actual amount of process you have in place is going to trail the amount of process you need. I suspect the diagram above describes a large majority of successfully-growing startups. This ""process lag"" generally manifests in a certain degree of chaos, communication breakdowns, and dropped balls. This is often characterised as ""growing pains"". If you're in a role that is responsible for scaling and growing an organisation, what this means is that you're in the business of adding and refining process. Ideally, you get the red ball in the diagram above to catch up with the green ball, and then to keep up with it as your organisation goes on its journey.

danmoskowitz1,"Everyone is excited about what AI can do. Fewer teams are honest about why their AI hasn't gone to production yet. Here is one of the clearer pattens that I've noticed. 1. Most companies aren't stuck on ""does AI work?"" They're stuck on ""can this safely run in prod?"" AI experimentation is mostly solved. The real bottleneck is everything that comes after the fancy demo: security, durability, and observability. That's the last mile where adoption stalls. 2. AI failures don't look like normal software failures. Also, the blast radius is potentially bigger. Model outages, silent hallucinations, prompt injection, general API weirdness that throws agents off. If you can't get a handle on these things, then it isn't safe to let your agentic workflow touch sensitive live data. 3. The next wave of AI value comes from infrastructure, not prompt engineering. The biggest winners in production will be teams that invest early in the tooling that makes agentic workflows secure, durable, and observable at scale.

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"Setting up your hypothesis test for success as a data scientist is critical. I want to go deep with you on exactly how I work with stakeholders ahead of launching a test. This step is crucial to make sure that once a test is done running, we’ll actually be able to analyze it. This includes: A well defined hypothesis A solid test design Knowing your sample size Understanding potential conflicts Population criteria (who are we testing) Test duration (it’s like the cousin of sample size) Success metrics Decisions that will be made based on results This is obviously a lot of information. Before we jump in, here is how I keep it all organized: I recently created a google doc at work so that stakeholders and analytics could align on all the information to fully scope a test upfront. This also gives you (the analyst/data scientist) a bit of an insurance policy. It’s possible the business decides to go with a design or a sample size that wasn’t your recommendation. If things end up working out less than stellar (not enough data, design that is basically impossible to analyze), you have your original suggestions documented. In my previous article I wrote: “Sit down with marketing and other stakeholders before the launch of the A/B test to understand the business implications, what they’re hoping to learn, who they’re testing, and how they’re testing. In my experience, everyone is set up for success when you’re viewed as a thought partner in helping to construct the test design, and have agreed upon the scope of the analysis ahead of launch.” Well, this is literally what I’m talking about: This document was born of things that we often see in industry: Hypothesis I’ve seen scenarios that look like “we’re going to make this change, and then we’d like you to read out on the results”. So, your hypothesis is what? You’re going to make this change, and what do you expect to happen? Why are we doing this? A hypothesis clearly states the change that is being made, the impact you expect it to have, and why you think it will have that impact. It’s not an open-ended statement. You are testing a measurable response to a change. It’s ok to be a stickler, this is your foundation. Test Design The test design needs to be solid, so you’ll want to have an understanding of exactly what change is being made between test and control. If you’re approached by a stakeholder with a design that won’t allow you to accurately measure criteria, you’ll want to coach them on how they could design the test more effectively to read out on the results. I cover test design a bit in my article here . Sample Size You need to understand the sample size ahead of launch, and your expected effect size. If you run with a small sample and need an unreasonable effect size for it to be significant, it’s most likely not worth running. Time to rethink your sample and your design. Sarah Nooravi recently wrote a great article on determining sample size for a test. You can find Sarah’s article here. An example might be that you want to test the effect of offering a service credit to select customers. You have a certain budget worth of credits you’re allowed to give out. So you’re hoping you can have 1,500 in test and 1,500 in control (this is small). The test experience sees the service along with a coupon, and the control experience sees content advertising the service but does not see any mention of the credit. If the average purchase rate is 13.3% you would need a 2.6 point increase (15.9%) in the control to see significance at 0.95 confidence. This is a large effect size that we probably won’t achieve (unless the credit is AMAZING). It’s good to know these things upfront so that you can make changes (for instance, reduce the amount of the credit to allow for additional sample size, ask for extra budget, etc). Potential Conflicts: It’s possible that 2 different groups in your organization could be running tests at the same time that conflict with each other, resulting in data that is junk for potentially both cases. (I actually used to run a “testing governance” meeting at my previous job to proactively identify these cases, this might be something you want to consider). An example of a conflict might be that the acquisition team is running an ad in Google advertising 500 business cards for $10. But if at the same time this test was running another team was running a pricing test on the business card product page that doesn’t respect the ad that is driving traffic, the acquisition team’s test is not getting the experience they thought they were! Customers will see a different price than what is advertised, and this has negative implications all around. It is so important in a large analytics organization to be collaborating across teams and have an understanding of the tests in flight and how they could impact your test. Population criteria Obviously you want to target the correct people. But often I’ve seen criteria so specific that the results of the test need to be caveated with “These results are not representative of our customer base, this effect is for people who [[lists criteria here]].” If your test targeted super performers, you know that it doesn’t apply to everyone in the base, but you want to make sure it is spelled out or doesn’t get miscommunicated to a more broad audience. Test duration This is often directly related to sample size. ( see Sarah’s article ) You’ll want to estimate how long you’ll need to run the test to achieve the required sample size. Maybe you’re randomly sampling from the base and already have sufficient population to choose from. But often we’re testing an experience for new customers, or we’re testing a change on the website and we need to wait for traffic to visit the site and view the change. If it’s going to take 6 months of running to get the required sample size, you probably want to rethink your population criteria or what you’re testing. And better to know that upfront. Success Metrics This is an important one to talk through. If you’ve been running tests previously, I’m sure you’ve had stakeholders ask you for the kitchen sink in terms of analysis. If your hypothesis is that a message about a new feature on the website will drive people to go see that feature; it is reasonable to check how many people visited that page and whether or not people downloaded/used that feature. This would probably be too benign to cause cancellations, or effect upsell/cross-sell metrics, so make sure you’re clear about what the analysis will and will not include. And try not to make a mountain out of a molehill unless you’re testing something that is a dramatic change and has large implications for the business. Decisions! Getting agreement ahead of time on what decisions will be made based on the results of the test is imperative. Have you ever been in a situation where the business tests something, it’s not significant, and then they roll it out anyways? Well then that really didn’t need to be a test, they could have just rolled it out. There are endless opportunities for tests that will guide the direction of the business, don’t get caught up in a test that isn’t actually a test. Conclusion Of course, each of these areas could have been explained in much more depth. But the main point is that there are a number of items that you want to have a discussion about before a test launches. Especially if you’re on the hook for doing the analysis, you want to have the complete picture and context so that you can analyze the test appropriately. I hope this helps you to be more collaborative with your business partners and potentially be more “proactive” rather than “reactive”. No one has any fun when you run a test and then later find out it should have been scoped differently. Adding a little extra work and clarification upfront can save you some heartache later on. Consider creating a document like the one I have pictured above for scoping your future tests, and you’ll have a full understanding of the goals and implications of your next test ahead of launch.

stephaniehillsphd,"I once had a team of engineers who were stuck in a cycle of doing things “the way they’ve always been done.” Every idea was met with “that won’t work” or “we don’t have time.” Sound familiar? I knew something had to change. So, I took a page from Amazon’s playbook. Their famous “Two-Pizza Teams” ensure teams are small, agile, and empowered to innovate without bureaucracy slowing them down. I applied that concept—giving my team the autonomy, tools, and confidence to experiment. The results? Ideas that had been buried under red tape came to life. Productivity soared. Engagement increased. Most importantly, we created solutions that made a real impact. 🔥 10 Ways to Build a CULTURE OF INNOVATION in Your Team 🔥 1️⃣ Empower Small, Agile Teams – Keep teams small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Autonomy fuels creativity. 2️⃣ Encourage Risk-Taking – Innovation thrives where failure isn’t punished but seen as a step toward success. 3️⃣ Implement a ‘Day 1’ Mindset – Never get comfortable. Stay in startup mode, always challenging the status quo. 4️⃣ Make Experimentation the Norm – Have a budget for testing new ideas. Not every experiment wins, but all drive learning. 5️⃣ Remove Bureaucracy – Long approval chains kill momentum. Enable teams to act fast. 6️⃣ Recognize and Reward Innovation – Celebrate bold ideas, not just successful ones. 7️⃣ Listen to Your Customers – The best ideas come from solving real problems. Be obsessed with their needs. 8️⃣ Lead by Example – If leaders aren’t innovating, teams won’t either. Model the behavior you want to see. 9️⃣ Prioritize Speed Over Perfection – Get ideas into the real world quickly. Iterate and improve based on real feedback. 🔟 Create Psychological Safety – A culture of innovation starts with people feeling safe to speak up, take risks, and challenge norms. Innovation isn’t an event—it’s a habit. The best teams don’t wait for inspiration; they build systems that make innovation inevitable.

dharmesh,"One thing that I wish I had learned earlier in my entrepreneurial career is this: Tools are bought, transformations are sold. Here's a clip of a talk I gave at the SaaStr Conference in San Francisco. First, let's talk about the difference? What do I mean by tools, and what do I mean by transformations? Tools Sometimes, the product you are selling is in a category that is well understood. Customers know the category, they know what other products are in that category, and they may previously have used another tool in the category. They don’t have to learn a ton to understand what the tool does. They don’t have to go through an existential crisis to adopt the tool -- it solves a specific problem, and can be implemented without having to rethink how they do things. Examples of tools are a to-do list app, or a time tracking system. I’m not saying that these products can’t be sophisticated or differentiated, what I am saying is that customers have a pretty good sense for what the product is going to do for them and why they might need it. Transformations Sometimes, the product you are selling is transformational . Adopting it requires customers to rethink all or parts of their business. Often it requires rethinking their career . It requires transformational change. Example: The “inbound marketing platform” HubSpot was selling in our early years. The premise of our product was: “The way you’ve been doing marketing is fundamentally broken and doesn’t work as well anymore. You’re going to have to do it very, very differently. Our product can help.” Convincing professional marketers that all the things they had spent their careers doing (and getting good at) was less relevant now (like buying lists, putting up a booth at a tradeshow, etc.) was not an easy thing to do. We were asking for a transformative change in their thinking. It's hard to change. Convincing someone else to change is even harder. Tools Are Bought, Transformations Are Sold If you’re selling a tool, you might be able to put a great website up, explain what your product does, perhaps contrast it to other tools in the market, tell customers the price and provide a way for them to buy it. Easy-breezy. If you’re selling a transformation, a website is not going to be enough. If you’re asking someone to make a massive change to how they do things, you’re going to likely have to sell . First, you’ll have to sell them on the reason why change is necessary. Without making that sale, you’re not going to be able to sell them on your particular product. So, if you've got a transformational product, you're likely going to need sales people to sell it. Not ones that have aggressive sales tactics and worry about how quickly they can close -- but ones that know that the prospective customer has to be sold on the change first before you can even start to have a conversation about the product. Tips On Selling A Transformative Product If ever there was a time you needed marketing, this is it. You need to tell the story of how the world has changed and what companies need to do to leverage the change (or at a bare minimum, adjust to it). When it comes to recognizing the need for change, you don’t have to go it alone. Chances are, there are other companies that also benefit from the particular change you are advocating (just like there were many companies pushing for “inbound marketing” when HubSpot first got started. Work with other companies (even if they’re competitors) to spread the word, and increase the size of the pie. As you build a base of “converts” that are aligned with how you see the world, work to pull those people into a community . Help them connect to each other. Support them in their efforts. Recognize their achievements. When hiring sales people, remember that you need people that can help teach people about the change. Why it’s important. What happens if they don’t make the change. Without first convincing the customer that change is necessary, it is impossible to sell them on your product. If you start with “aggressive” sales people that are only interested in selling the product, you are unlikely to be successful. In the early days/weeks/months, recognize that your customers are likely going to need a lot of hand-holding and help. It will feel uncomfortable, because there’s a voice in your head telling you “this won’t scale”. The voice is right -- it won’t. But you still need to do it right now . For those early customers, you have to go as far as you need to in order to help them be successful. You can worry about scaling later. If you have so many customers that you can’t afford to give them the same level of help anymore, that’s a high quality problem. Much better problem to solve than “We don’t have anybody that’s really succeeded with our product yet.” It's easy for people to buy a tool. Buying into a transformation is a journey.

edward-singapore,"What does success in cyber defence look like? Usually, it looks like nothing happened. Last year, Singapore’s telecommunications infrastructure came under a serious cyber threat. The response that followed — Operation Cyber Guardian — became the largest cyber defence operation in Singapore. I had the privilege of driving this operation at the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) , alongside my colleagues at IMDA and many others across government and industry. It was a marathon. Long nights. Parallel investigations. Careful containment. Re-checking assumptions. Making hard calls with incomplete information — and doing so calmly, professionally, and together. What I’m most proud of is the team of more than 100 officers who pulled this off. The CSA officers who stayed on watch, connected the dots, and quietly carried the operational burden. The Whole-of-Government partners who leaned in immediately, shared information freely, and moved as one team. The telco cyber defenders who worked shoulder to shoulder with us to find and fix the attacker. And above all, the collective trust that allowed us to act quickly — without friction, without ego, without noise. A few reflections that stayed with me: • Teamwork is not a slogan — it is a capability. • Speed in crisis comes from trust built long before the incident. • Good cyber defence is measured by outcomes, not headlines. Most people will never know this operation took place. And that’s exactly how it should be. To everyone across CSA, our Whole-of-Government partners, and industry colleagues who did the hard, unglamorous work behind the scenes — thank you. You reminded me that in cyber defence, no one defends alone, and quiet professionalism is often the strongest form of collective leadership.

dharmesh,"A concept is making the rounds in AI circles right now that has many people very excited: context graphs . Foundation Capital published a piece calling it ""AI's trillion-dollar opportunity."" Engineers and founders are writing technical breakdowns of how it would work, and VCs are looking for startups building in this space. The basic premise is simple but powerful: our systems capture what happened, but not the why . And in an agentic world, that ""why"" becomes critical. The idea is elegant, intellectually compelling, and really appeals to the systems thinker in me. Plus, it has the word ""graph"" in it, and I LOVE graphs. Have loved them for decades. Fun fact, the HubSpot logo is a zoomed in look at a graph (with a node in the middle). The idea underlying context graphs is very powerful, but I think we need a reality check about where companies actually are versus where this conversation assumes they are. So let's break down: What context graphs actually are Why smart people think they're important Where I think the hype meets reality What Is a Context Graph? Here's the core idea: most of our current systems capture what happened, but not why it happened. Why did this deal need to be escalated to legal review? Why did we pick Providence, RI for our next retail store? Why did we decide to discontinue product [X]? That reasoning -- the decision traces, the exceptions, the precedents -- lives scattered across Slack, work calls, and inside people's heads. It's insider knowledge that builds up as employees gain experience and resets every time someone leaves. A context graph is meant to capture all of that systematically. Not just the final state, but the full sequence of decisions: what inputs were considered, what policies were evaluated, what exceptions were granted, who approved what, and why. It's a system of record for decisions , not just data. I think of it as a system of reasoning . (But I’m not promoting that as a phrase, because it’s easily confused with the reasoning that an LLM does). Why Smart People Are Bullish The argument for why context graphs are important comes down to agents. As AI agents begin handling real workflows -- reviewing deals, resolving tickets, and more -- they run into the same gray areas humans face in everyday work. Humans handle those situations using judgment and insider context built through experience, but agents don't have access to that layer. They see the final state in the CRM, not the reasoning that led there. Context graphs are supposed to solve this. By capturing decision traces as agents work, you build a queryable history of real-world precedents. Over time, exceptions become encoded knowledge. The organization stops relying on oral tradition and starts learning from its accumulated actions. Smart folks like Jaya Gupta at Foundation Capital are making compelling cases . Startups building ""systems of agents"" could have a structural advantage because they sit in the execution path -- they see the full context at decision time. The theory is elegant. Why I’m A Wee Bit Skeptical But here's the thing about elegant ideas: history is full of concepts that were intellectually compelling but didn't take off in practice. The reason is usually the same. They were just a tad too abstract. To get from ""here"" to ""there,"" you need infrastructure, cooperation, and adoption that doesn't exist yet. You a path from here to there and need to build bridges and tunnels to get around the obstacles you will invariably run into. And right now, my take is that most companies are nowhere near ready for context graphs. We’re barely at the point where semi-autonomous agents are getting deployed for some key use cases (like customer service). Companies are still struggling with basic data unification. They're still trying to get their CRM, support system, and product data to talk to each other. They're early in their adoption cycle of AI -- figuring out if an AI assistant can handle tier-1 support. Agents -- whose activity is supposed to generate the decision traces that populate the context graph -- are themselves very early and not widely adopted. Asking companies to capture decision traces when they are still bringing their data efforts in order and haven't even deployed agents at scale yet is sort of like asking someone to install a three-car garage when they don't own a single car. I'd love to live in the world where context graphs exist. That's why HubSpot is building toward that kind of future as part of our agentic customer platform. It's an important piece of the puzzle. But I think we need to be more pragmatic about the timeline and our expectations. Most businesses are still figuring out how to use AI to drive real, tangible value. They're not ready to instrument their agent orchestration layer with decision traces. And that's okay. That's the reality of adoption curves. Context graphs (or something like it) are a beautiful idea that will matter eventually. It feels inevitable. The question is when that ""eventually"" arrives, and what has to happen between now and then to make it real.

ybernstein,"In early history, one of the hallmarks of an advanced society was that it used writing to codify knowledge. Writing enabled more complex social structures and technologies to emerge, and the scalable distribution enabled by the printing press accelerated this massively. It's 2018. Do you follow an oral tradition or a written tradition? When your organisation is small and young, it is natural to share knowledge orally. After all, when there are only three of you the overheads of using formal issue tracking, written roadmaps, architectural documentation, onboarding guides seem very high when you could just have a quick chat. Just as with societies, though, as your organisation grows and becomes more complex that oral tradition quickly becomes a hindrance. Whereas the cost of propagating written knowledge is sublinear with respect to the size of an organisation and the passage of time, oral teaching is linear at best. Worse yet, oral histories are unreliable. Knowledge is lost to the vagaries of human memory, and by the departure of key personnel. Software is complex and technical. Ask any other professional in a complex technical field, from engineers to doctors to pilots, whether they would be comfortable relying on oral knowledge sharing instead of documentation, and they'll likely just stare at you as if you were mad.

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"If you’re someone who is looking to make a move to data science, there are some ways that you can polish your approach to get noticed during your job search. Assuming that you’ve built up the skills required for the job see if you’re able to leverage some of these tips: Optimize your resume (as best you can) for the job you WANT not the jobs you’ve HAD . Try to gain experience at your current job (if you’re a career changer), or work on your own data science projects at home. (continuous learning is a big plus). Develop a killer elevator pitch. OPTIMIZING YOUR RESUME FOR THE JOB YOU WANT: Describe your projects in a way that shows you’re results-focused. The points you’re going to want to demonstrate on your resume need to both: Demonstrate that you understand general corporate culture, and showcase your collaborative, result achieving, problem solving and self-managing competencies. Show that you have the technical chops as a data scientist. The first bullet takes a lot of thought – it is really easy to list job duties, it’s another thing to reword them effectively to highlight your true strengths and demonstrate how what you’ve done has improved the business. Your bullet points should be full of action verbs and results, even if you need to stretch yourself mentally to identify these. Did you automate a process that saved hours of time manually doing a task? That time saved is business value. Demonstrating that you’ve worked cross-functionally or presented results to the business are again, things that are desirable for the new job you want (data scientist). It is helpful to read job descriptions and see what companies are looking for, you’ll find consistent themes. If you look closely, you’ll see there are a lot of skills listed that aren’t necessarily technical. Make sure you shine when speaking to those softer skills. But of course, these softer skills need to be demonstrated in a way that still demonstrates an action and result. Do not just put a “soft skills” section on your resume and list a bunch of words with no context. “Show you have the technical chops as a data scientist”. This is pretty straight-forward. Try to use the verbiage from the actual job description for the job you’re applying to. You might want to sound fancy, but “empirical bayesian 3-stage hierarchical model” probably isn’t on the job description. Having this specifically listed on your resume isn’t going to help you pass ATS (the applicant tracking system), and the person in human resources who doesn’t have a data science background is not going to know whether that is relevant or not. Again, looking at multiple job descriptions and trying to gauge what type of language to use on your resume is helpful. GAIN EXPERIENCE AT YOUR CURRENT JOB OR WORK ON A PROJECT: If you currently have a job, do you have access to SQL? Does your company have a data warehouse or database? Can you file a ticket with the service desk to get SQL? Can you then play with data to make your own project? You could even go a step further and bring data from the database into R or Python. Maybe you make a nice decision tree that answers a business questions then wonderfully and concisely place your results of your project on your resume. Try to automate a task that’s repeatable that you do on a regular cadence. That’s next level resume content. You’re increasing efficiency in this scenario. If you’ve done data science projects on your own to round out your resume, make sure those bullets are full of action verbs and results, action verbs and results. I almost want to say it a third time. SQL Lite is open source, R is open source, Python is open source, there is tons of free data out there. The world can really be your oyster, but you’ll need to market these go-getter skills effectively. DEVELOP A KILLER ELEVATOR PITCH: A strong, well-targeted resume might open the door, but you need to keep that door open and keep the conversation going once the door has been opened. The resume does nothing more than open the door, that’s it. Getting your resume into the right hands can sometimes be difficult. Leveraging LinkedIn effectively can help bridge that gap. How do we begin the conversation if you’re reaching out to someone on LinkedIn to ask about opportunities? Important note: When cold reaching out to people on LinkedIn, this should be after you have visited the company website, found a job that you’re interested in and (pretty much) qualified for, and then you reach out to a relevant person with a well-targeted message. It is impossible to be well-targeted if you are reaching out to someone who works at a company that doesn’t have any positions available. Because you didn’t read a job description. So you wouldn’t be able to infer the needs of the business. Data Science is a large field, with many specializations, a blanket approach will not work. Back to the pitch. You’re results-focused, you’re innovative, and you view things from the business’ perspective. I’d suggest starting with something conversational, this will help if the person you’re messaging is already being inundated with requests. A comment about a post they made recently makes your connection come across as more authentic. Why you’re messaging: you’re interested in the open position, and you’re trying to get your resume to the correct person. Then mention a number of things concisely that are specifically mentioned on the job description. Basically saying “hi, look at me, I’m a fit.” Let them know that you’d really appreciate it if they’d simply forward you to the correct person (hopefully the person you’re messaging is the correct person, but there is also a chance it’s not the right person, so don’t assume). Close strong. You’re here to add value for the company, not to talk about your needs; imply you’re aware that you’re here to talk about how you can fit the needs of the business. Hi [name], I enjoyed your recent post on [topic] and I look forward to reading more of your posts. I noticed [company] is hiring for [position title], and I’m hoping I can get my resume in the right hands. I have an MS in Statistics, plus 7 years of real-world experience building models. I’m a wiz at SQL, modeling in R, and I have exposure to Python. I’d appreciate the opportunity to speak with the appropriate person about the open position, and share how I’ve delivered insights and added value for companies through the use of statistical methods. Thanks, Kristen Now you may have a very different background from me. However, you can talk about the education that you do have (concisely), the exposure that you do have to building models, about your technical chops, and that you want to deliver value. I hope that you’ll be able to use some of these suggestions. And I wish you a successful a rewarding career in data science. If you have additional suggestions for trying to make a change to data science, I’d love to hear your thoughts! The next article I post will be covering how to write crisp content for your resume that makes an impact, that article is here. Of course I go even deeper into these topics in the “Up-Level Your Resume” course. You can learn more about my resume course here.

that time saved is business value. demonstrating that youve worked cross-functionally or presented results to the business are again, things that are desirable for the new job you want data scientist. it is helpful to read job descriptions and see what companies are looking for, youll find consistent themes. if you look closely, youll see there are a lot of skills listed that arent necessarily technical. make sure you shine when speaking to those softer skills. but of course, these softer skills need to be demonstrated in a way that still demonstrates an action and result. do not just put a soft skills section on your resume and list a bunch of words with no context. show you have the technical chops as a data scientist. this is pretty straight-forward. try to use the verbiage from the actual job description for the job youre applying to. you might want to sound fancy, but empirical bayesian 3-stage hierarchical model probably isnt on the job description. having this specifically listed on your resume isnt going to help you pass ats the applicant tracking system, and the person in human resources who doesnt have a data science background is not going to know whether that is relevant or not. again, looking at multiple job descriptions and trying to gauge what type of language to use on your resume is helpful. gain experience at your current job or work on a project: if you currently have a job, do you have access to sql? does your company have a data warehouse or database? can you file a ticket with the service desk to get sql? can you then play with data to make your own project? you could even go a step further and bring data from the database into r or python. maybe you make a nice decision tree that answers a business questions then wonderfully and concisely place your results of your project on your resume. try to automate a task thats repeatable that you do on a regular cadence. thats next level resume content. youre increasing efficiency in this scenario. if youve done data science projects on your own to round out your resume, make sure those bullets are full of action verbs and results, action verbs and results. i almost want to say it a third time. sql lite is open source, r is open source, python is open source, there is tons of free data out there. the world can really be your oyster, but youll need to market these go-getter skills effectively. develop a killer elevator pitch: a strong, well-targeted resume might open the door, but you need to keep that door open and keep the conversation going once the door has been opened. the resume does nothing more than open the door, thats it. getting your resume into the right hands can sometimes be difficult. leveraging linkedin effectively can help bridge that gap. how do we begin the conversation if youre reaching out to someone on linkedin to ask about opportunities? important note: when cold reaching out to people on linkedin, this should be after you have visited the company website, found a job that youre interested in and pretty much qualified for, and then you reach out to a relevant person with a well-targeted message. it is impossible to be well-targeted if you are reaching out to someone who works at a company that doesnt have any positions available. because you didnt read a job description. so you wouldnt be able to infer the needs of the business. data science is a large field, with many specializations, a blanket approach will not work. back to the pitch. youre results-focused, youre innovative, and you view things from the business perspective. id suggest starting with something conversational, this will help if the person youre messaging is already being inundated with requests. a comment about a post they made recently makes your connection come across as more authentic. why youre messaging: youre interested in the open position, and youre trying to get your resume to the correct person. then mention a number of things concisely that are specifically mentioned on the job description. basically saying hi, look at me, im a fit. let them know that youd really appreciate it if theyd simply forward you to the correct person hopefully the person youre messaging is the correct person, but there is also a chance its not the right person, so dont assume. close strong. youre here to add value for the company, not to talk about your needs; imply youre aware that youre here to talk about how you can fit the needs of the business. hi name, i enjoyed your recent post on topic and i look forward to reading more of your posts. i noticed company is hiring for position title, and im hoping i can get my resume in the right hands. i have an ms in statistics, plus 7 years of real-world experience building models. im a wiz at sql, modeling in r, and i have exposure to python. id appreciate the opportunity to speak with the appropriate person about the open position, and share how ive delivered insights and added value for companies through the use of statistical methods. thanks, kristen now you may have a very different background from me. however, you can talk about the education that you do have concisely, the exposure that you do have to building models, about your technical chops, and that you want to deliver value. i hope that youll be able to use some of these suggestions. and i wish you a successful a rewarding career in data science. if you have additional suggestions for trying to make a change to data science, id love to hear your thoughts! the next article i post will be covering how to write crisp content for your resume that makes an impact, that article is here. of course i go even deeper into these topics in the up-level your resume course. you can learn more about my resume course here. originally posted on url",-15,too_long,"if youre someone who is looking to make a move to data science, there are some ways that you can polish your approach to get noticed during your job search",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,3,14,0,0,0,0,0,-18,3,4,1,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,35,35
dharmesh,"20 years ago, I started learning about SEO (Search Engine Optimization). This was before I co-founded HubSpot . I was still a grad student in Cambridge, MA, and had started a blog (OnStartups .com). I was interested in ways to grow my blog's reach and audience, and SEO was one of the ways to do that. Who doesn't want the thrill of free traffic from Google? I read the books and blog posts and watched videos and went to conferences. I tried to learn all the things. Now, I'm digging into what some call AIO (A.I. Optimization) or what I think of as SAO (Search AGENT Optimization). Regardless of what you call it, some things are the same, and some have changed. 1) Instead of a human typing what they are looking for into a box (""low-code tool for building agents"") they might go to Perplexity or ChatGPT. Instead of 10 blue links, they get one brilliant answer. 2) Or an autonomous agent working on behalf of a human might be scouring the web, pulling research together, synthesizing everything and providing the user with a detailed deep research report. But here's the one thing I learned about SEO 20 years ago that I think is still super-relevant in the age of SAO: In SEO, the key to winning over the long-term was to create the content that people would want to find and that was better than the alternatives. In the end, Google figures out what the best content for a given user is given their query, and ranks it in the search results. You just have to make sure that's you. Everything else is just tactics that help on the margin. I simplify this to: SEO = Make Things Helpful to Humans + Make Things Easy For The Search Bot. Same is true for SAO/AIO: The key to winning in the long-term is to Make Things Helpful to Humans + Make Things Easy for the Search Agent. Two things are different: 1) What's ultimately helpful for the human may not be a 1200 word blog post about your industry. Maybe it's just clear, well structured information about your product or service and the answer to common questions. Pro tip: If you still don't have any pricing information on your website, you might want to revisit that. 2) What's helpful for the AI/agent is the ability for it to get to the information it needs in order to achieve it's goal (answering a question for the human it works for). This means supporting ways for the agent to easily get to important things in a structured way. Like more information in the robots.txt. An llms.txt file to describe what is ""discoverabe"". Maybe MCP (Model Context Protocol) support. In addition to regular web pages, perhaps ""endpoints"" that return data in JSON. Perhaps an easily findable agent of your own that can answer specific questions the buyer's agent has. The thing to remember is that though your traffic from SEO may be down, your prospective customers didn't fall off the planet and disappear. They're just doing their search and research differently. As always, the key to success is to be where your customers AND THEIR AGENTS are, make it easy for the human+agent to meet their needs and establish brand credibility and trust. Remember: People's available attention is increasingly scarce, and an agent's attention is infinite. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't make the agent's life easy . Those that do will do better.

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"I wanted to write a quick article about creating image datasets from video for computer vision. Here we’ll be taking a video that I took on my phone and create training and validation datasets from the video in R. My hope is that someone who is new to playing with computer vision stumbles on this article and that I’m able to save this person some time and extra googling. I get giddy when I find a blog article that does exactly what I want and is simple to understand, I’m just trying to pay it forward. The project I’m working on is written in python, so unfortunately I won’t be helping you go end-to-end here, unless you’re looking to continue in python. To create the dataset, I used the av library in R. The av library in R makes it crazy simple to split a video you take on your phone into a bunch of images and save them in a folder. Once you have that, you’ll of course need to take a random sample of files to place in a training dataset folder you’ll create, and then you’ll want to place the remaining images in a validation dataset folder. Easy peasy. I did not attempt to do anything fancy, I’m hoping this will feel very friendly. Let's jump in. ### The only library we need for this: library(""av"") ### The path where you've saved the video and where you want your ### images video_path = ""[path to movie]/[your movie].MOV"" path = ""[path to new folder]"" ### set your working directory to be where the files are stored setwd(path) ### Function that will give you all your frames in a folder ### First we're just dumping all of the images into a single ### folder, we'll split test and validation afterwards av_video_images(video = video_path, destdir = path, format = ""jpg"", fps = NULL) ### How many images are in that folder? Just checking for ### context length(list.files()) Now we have a folder with all of our images. Next we’re going to take a random sample of 70% of the images for our training set. Then we’ll move those files to a training folder. Get excited to move some files around! #### Now creating the testing and validation sets ### Now Take a sample of 70% of the images for the training set, we do not want with replacement images_training <- sample(list.files(),length(list.files())*.7, replace = FALSE) #### Create training and validation folders so we have a place to store our ### photos #### If the training folder does not exist, create training folder (with ### dir.create), else tell me it already exists. ifelse(!dir.exists(""training""), dir.create(""training""), ""Folder exists already"") ifelse(!dir.exists(""validation""), dir.create(""validation""), ""Folder exists already"") ### Place training images in the training folder ### Here we are going to loop through each image and copy the folder from the ### old path ### to the new path (in our training folder) for (image in images_training) { new_place <- file.path(path, ""training"",image) ### pointing to the new training file path old_place <- file.path(path,image) file.copy(from = old_place, to = new_place) } Next we’re going to remove the training images from their original folder, so that all we’ll have left in the original folder is the validation images. Just gonna do a little cleanup here. To do this, we’ll simply loop through each image, and in each iteration of the loop, we’re removing an image. for (image in images_training) { file.remove(path, image) } ### Double check that the length looks right length(list.files()) ### Put remaining image files in validation folder images_validation <- list.files() for (image in images_validation) { new_place <- file.path(path, ""validation"", image) old_place <- file.path(path,image) file.copy(from = old_place, to = new_place) } #### Remove the validation images from the old folder (this is just cleanup) #### For is image in the remaining list of files, remove the image. for (image in list.files()) { file.remove(path, image) } Now you’re all set up to start using these images from a video you’ve taken yourself! If you’re playing with computer vision, I highly suggest checking out the cometr library. With just a couple lines of code it’ll store a snapshot of your dependencies, code and anything else you need for your model to be reproducible. This is an absolute life saver when you later run into a bug and you’re not sure if it’s a problem with your dependencies, etc. cometr makes it so you’ll be able to just check on your last successful run, easily compare with the current code, see what the discrepancy was, and continue on your merry way. If the libraries for computer vision that you’re using integrate with comet, then you’ll also get a bunch of metrics and graphics to help you assess your model right out of the box. From here, you’ll want to create bounding boxes for the images. The easiest way I’ve found to do this is leveraging the labelImg library in python. You just pip install the labelImg package and then run labelImg in python and a GUI pops up for creating the bounding boxes. It really can’t get much easier than that. If you happen upon a great way to label the images that doesn’t involve python, please let me know. I would love to suggest something non-python here because this is obviously not a python article. Thanks for reading! Hope you have the easiest time turning your video into an image dataset for training and validation, and may your object detection models detect all the things.

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"If you’re new to the field of Data Science, I wanted to offer some tips on how to transition from presentations you gave in academia to creating effective presentations for industry. Unfortunately, if your background is of the math, stats, or computer science variety, no one probably prepared you for creating an awesome data science presentations in industry. And the truth is, it takes practice. In academia, we share tables of t-stats and p-values and talk heavily about mathematical formulas. That is basically the opposite of what you’d want to do when presenting to a non-technical audience. If your audience is full of a bunch of STEM PhD’s then have at it, but in many instances we need to adjust the way we think about presenting our technical material. I could go on and on forever about this topic, but here we’ll cover: Talking about model output without talking about the model Painting the picture using actual customers or inputs Putting in the Time to Tell the Story Talking about model output without talking about the model Certain models really lend themselves well to this. Logistic regression, decision trees, they’re just screaming to be brought to life. You don’t want to be copy/pasting model output into your data science presentations. You also don’t want to be formatting the output into a nice table and pasting it into your presentation. You want to tell the story and log odds certainly are not going to tell the story for your stakeholders. A good first step for a logistic regression model would just be to exponentiate the log odds so that you’re at least dealing in terms of odds. Since this output is multiplicative, you can say: “For each unit increase of [variable] we expect to see a lift of x% on average with everything else held constant.” So instead of talking about technical aspects of the model, we’re just talking about how the different drivers effect the output. We could, however, take this one step further. Using Actual Customers to Paint the Picture I love using real-life use cases to demonstrate how the model is working. Above we see something similar to what I presented when talking about my seasonality model. Of course I changed his name for this post, but in the presentation I would talk about this person’s business, why it’s seasonal, show the obvious seasonal pattern, and let them know that the model classified this person as seasonal. I’m not talking about fourier transforms, I’m describing how real people are being categorized and how we might want to think about marketing to them. Digging in deep like this also helps me to better understand the big picture of what is going on. We all know that when we dig deeper we see some crazy behavioral patterns. Pulling specific customers/use cases works for other types of models as well. You built a retention model? Choose a couple people with a high probability of churning, and a couple with a low probability of churning and talk about those people. “Mary here has been a customer for a long time, but she has been less engaged recently and hasn’t done x, y , or z (model drivers), so the probability of her cancelling her subscription is high, even though customers with longer tenure are usually less likely to leave.” Putting in the Time to Tell the Story As stated before, it takes some extra work to put these things together. Another great example is in cluster analysis. You could create a slide for each attribute, but then people would need to comb through multiple slides to figure out WHO cluster 1 really is vs. cluster 2, etc. You want to aggregate all of this information for your consumer. And I’m not above coming up with cheesy names for my segments, it just comes with the territory :). It’s worth noting here that if I didn’t aggregate all this information by cluster, I also wouldn’t be able to speak at a high level about who was actually getting into these different clusters. That would be a large miss on my behalf, because at the end of the day, your stakeholders want to understand the big picture of these clusters. Every analysis I present I spend time thinking about what the appropriate flow should be for the story the data can tell. I might need additional information like market penetration by geography, (or anything, the possibilities are endless). The number of small businesses by geography may not have been something I had in my model, but with a little google search I can find it. Put in the little extra work to do the calculation for market penetration, and then create a map and use this information to further support my story. Or maybe I learn that market penetration doesn’t support my story and I need to do more analysis to get to the real heart of what is going on. We’re detectives. And we’re not just dealing with the data that is actually in the model. We’re trying to explore anything that might give interesting insight and help to tell the story. Also, if you’re doing the extra work and find your story is invalidated, you just saved yourself some heartache. It’s way worse when you present first, and then later realize your conclusions were off. womp womp. Closing comments Before you start building a model, you were making sure that the output would be actionable, right? At the end of your presentation you certainly want to speak to next steps on how your model can be used and add value whether that’s coming up with ideas on how you can communicate with customers in a new way that you think they’ll respond to, reduce retention, increase acquisition, etc. But spell it out. Spend the time to come up with specific examples of how someone could use this output. I’d also like to mention that learning best practices for creating great visualizations will help you immensely. There are two articles by Kate Strachnyi that cover pieces of this topic. You can find those articles here and here . If you create a slide and have trouble finding what the “so what?” is of the slide, it probably belongs in the appendix. When you’re creating the first couple decks of your career it might crush you to not include a slide that you spent a lot of time on, but if it doesn’t add something interesting, unfortunately that slide belongs in the appendix. I hope you found at least one tip in this article that you’ll be able to apply to your next data science presentation. If I can help just one person create a kick-ass presentation, it’ll be worth it.

choose a couple people with a high probability of churning, and a couple with a low probability of churning and talk about those people. mary here has been a customer for a long time, but she has been less engaged recently and hasnt done x, y , or z model drivers, so the probability of her cancelling her subscription is high, even though customers with longer tenure are usually less likely to leave. putting in the time to tell the story as stated before, it takes some extra work to put these things together. another great example is in cluster analysis. you could create a slide for each attribute, but then people would need to comb through multiple slides to figure out who cluster 1 really is vs. cluster 2, etc. you want to aggregate all of this information for your consumer. and im not above coming up with cheesy names for my segments, it just comes with the territory :. its worth noting here that if i didnt aggregate all this information by cluster, i also wouldnt be able to speak at a high level about who was actually getting into these different clusters. that would be a large miss on my behalf, because at the end of the day, your stakeholders want to understand the big picture of these clusters. every analysis i present i spend time thinking about what the appropriate flow should be for the story the data can tell. i might need additional information like market penetration by geography, or anything, the possibilities are endless. the number of small businesses by geography may not have been something i had in my model, but with a little google search i can find it. put in the little extra work to do the calculation for market penetration, and then create a map and use this information to further support my story. or maybe i learn that market penetration doesnt support my story and i need to do more analysis to get to the real heart of what is going on. were detectives. and were not just dealing with the data that is actually in the model. were trying to explore anything that might give interesting insight and help to tell the story. also, if youre doing the extra work and find your story is invalidated, you just saved yourself some heartache. its way worse when you present first, and then later realize your conclusions were off. womp womp. closing comments before you start building a model, you were making sure that the output would be actionable, right?

stephaniehillsphd,"🚀 Most people don’t fail because they lack talent or drive. They fail because they hide in plain sight—telling themselves they are waiting for the “right time”. 💼 My first job in the corporate world, I was overwhelmed. I told myself I was playing it smart—observing, waiting for the perfect time to step up. I thought if I just worked hard enough, someone would notice. But the truth? I was avoiding risk. I was playing defense in a game that only rewards offense. Have you ever done this?You know you’re capable of more. You’ve got the skills, the knowledge, the drive—but instead of stepping up, you hold back. ❌ You don’t ask for the promotion because you don’t feel “ready” yet. 🚫 You don’t start your business because of others' opinions. 😟 You don’t put yourself out there because what if you fail? And while you’re overthinking, someone else—less qualified but more confident—is taking the opportunities you keep passing up. Not because they’re better. But because they moved. ⚠️ And here’s the reality—the system is built to keep you playing small. 🏢 Companies reward ""team players"" who don’t rock the boat. 🌍 Society tells you to be “grateful” instead of ambitious. 🗣️ Even the people closest to you will say, “Are you sure? That sounds risky.” They’re not trying to sabotage you—but they are keeping you comfortable. And comfort is the enemy of growth. 🔥 How to Step Out & Own It 💥 So what do you do? You take the damn shot. And here’s exactly how you do it: 🆔 Step 1: Change Your Identity Stop thinking of yourself as “waiting for your chance.” You’re already the person who deserves it—you just need to start acting like it. Decide who you are today. 🚀 If you’re in a job, stop seeing yourself as an “employee” and start acting like a leader before you have the title. 💰 If you’re in business, stop seeing yourself as “trying to grow” and start operating like a 7-figure entrepreneur now. 📈 Step 2: Build Proof & Stack Small Wins Confidence doesn’t come from waiting. It comes from action. Stack small wins every day. 🎤 Speak up in the next meeting. 🎥 Go live on social media for the first time. 💼 Make an offer TODAY instead of tweaking your website for the 10th time. Wins compound. The more you do, the more unstoppable you become. 🔥 Step 3: Burn the Boats Stop keeping a backup plan for why you’re not stepping up. Cut off your escape route. Make failure impossible. 💵 If you want the raise, schedule the meeting now. 📆 If you want to launch, set a date and announce it. If you want to be seen, start showing up every single day—no excuses. 🏆 Step 4: Get in the Right Rooms You don’t rise by staying around people who reinforce your smallness. You need to be in rooms where success is normal, where people are already playing bigger. 🎯 Get a mentor who has the results you want. 🤝 Join masterminds or groups that challenge you. ⏳ Cut back time with people who talk you out of your potential. 🚀 Step 5: Make Power Moves Daily The fastest way to stop hiding? Make moves so big you can’t go back. 📢 Post the content. 💬 Make the ask. 💸 Charge what you’re worth. 🏁 Launch the thing. 🚀 Take the leap. 🎯 Because if you want to win... You don’t wait.

guybe,"Ten years ago, two major things happened in my life. First, our twins, Neta and Omer, were born. Second, I started the next chapter of my career by joining #Microsoft as a CSA. After 20 years in software engineering, it turned out to be one of the most incredible roles I’ve ever had. Every single day I learned something new -working with many customers on #AI , #IoT , and cloud-native technologies, speaking on stages, and driving presales engagements and customer success. It was intense, inspiring, and deeply rewarding. Five years later, I decided to go back to what I enjoy the most: coding. I joined #Microsoft #CSE (known today as #ISE ), working alongside incredibly talented engineers on co-innovation and co-engineering with Microsoft’s most strategic customers. Focusing on the domain I love most and passionate about - #AI - assembled as teams of data scientists and software engineers and partnered closely with customers to work on their most innovative and challenging projects. Today marks my 10-year anniversary at #Microsoft , in a role I truly enjoy. I’m genuinely happy to wake up every morning and work on impactful projects with the best teammates. I’d like to pause and give a special shout-out to all my mentors, managers, and colleagues who believed in me and gave me opportunities to grow, learn, balance time at work and spending time with my dear family.

shivamdas040790,"We recently sat down with our trial users to talk about something deeper than specs, everyday life. In a world where we are constantly connected, the role of the mobile device is shifting from a hardware tool to a cognitive partner. After reviewing our latest interview sessions, three clear themes emerged: 1. The Performance Paradox: Users no longer care about raw speed in a vacuum.They care about sustained performance. Can the phone handle a 2 hour gaming session or a heavy multitasking workday without the heat factor? Reliability is the new fast. 2. Camera as a Memory Tool, Not Just a Lens. We are seeing a shift from taking a photo to capturing a feeling. Users are looking for AI that doesnt just sharpen an image, but understands the lighting and emotion of the moment, something brands like OPPO are doubling down on to democratize professional grade creativity. 3. From Manual to Intuitive (The OPPO Factor). How is user behavior changing? It’s becoming more passive in the best way. Features that manage battery life intelligently are teaching users to trust their devices more. We are moving towards an invisible UI where the tech works in the background so the human can stay in the moment.

dharmesh,"AI Won't Kill Software — It'll Catapult It Every few months the industry plays a giant game of telephone. Someone super-smart says something super-sharp. The line gets retweeted, reinterpreted, re-spun — and before long we have a chorus confidently singing, ""AI will kill software."" It's attention-getting and is easy to believe, but also misguided. AI is not going to kill the software market, it’s going to catapult it. Disclosure: I'm the co-founder of HubSpot and have been building software companies for 30+ years. That means I'm notably biased, but not necessarily wrong. I'm also an indie investor in OpenAI, Replit, Lovable and a bunch of other AI companies. Enter SaaS, Stage Left Let's roll the tape back to the late '90s. Salesforce enters with a transformative idea and a marketing masterstroke: ""NO SOFTWARE"". The slogan was everywhere — buttons, billboards, and booth backdrops. Marc Benioff, Salesforce's founder was never lacking in creativity, courage or charisma. It got everyone's attention. Partly because it was just the right mix of compelling and confusing. The irony that made skeptics squint was that a software company was saying ""No Software."" But they misunderstood what Benioff meant. He wasn't burying software; he was burying on-prem software. The party was moving out of the server cabinet and into the cloud. And the label we eventually gave that shift? Software as a Service. That was much less paradoxical — it's got the word ""software"" right there in the name. SaaS didn't kill software; SaaS was software — just in a different package. Instead of running on premises, it was delivered over the Internet, usually inside of a web browser. Instead of having a perpetual license to the software as was common in the earlier generation, you could subscribe to software. Instead of every company having its own database/servers, etc. we had multi-tenancy whereby multiple companies (often hundreds or thousands) could run in the same infrastructure. This impacted the economics of the industry considerably. What SaaS did was elevate software by making things better for customers and also better for the software companies serving them. Hold that thought — because history is about to rhyme. Now, a quarter-century later, we're watching the same movie with a different cast. The doomsayers are back, the paradox is back, but this time the villain isn't on-prem software—it's software itself. And once again, they're missing the plot twist. Fast Forward 25 Years: Enter AI, Stage Center At this point I don't need to make the case for AI being a transformative new technology. AI is arguably the most transformative technology since the internet itself—and unlike the internet, it doesn't just connect human intelligence, it amplifies it. AI isn't nibbling at the edges; it's rewriting the recipe across many industries. AI is reshaping software at every level: how we build it (with coding agents like Lovable and Replit that turn developers into conductors rather than code typists), who can build it (your marketing manager can now sketch a working app over lunch), and how it connects (goodbye, point-to-point integrations; hello, Model Context Protocol). Even the business model is evolving—from seats to outcomes, from subscriptions to consumption. Consider this: the global software market is approaching $1 trillion annually. If AI makes us just 2x more productive at solving problems, we're not looking at a smaller market—we're looking at a multiples larger one. There's also a big change to how some software will be distributed. In the pre-AI world, most software capability was delivered through a web browser. In the future, it's conceivable that instead of running in a browser, more applications run inside an AI application like OpenAI 's ChatGPT which has over 700M weekly active users. (To put that in perspective, that's more than 2x the population of the United States checking in with an AI every week. When was the last time any software platform grew that fast? Hint: never.) We're witnessing a platform shift as significant as mobile or the web itself—except this time, the platform thinks. So here's my point: There are definitely lots of changes happening. But, AI is not going to kill the software industry, it's going to kill software companies that don't adapt to the change. How To Not Get Crushed So if you're a software company right now, you're probably wondering if you're the disrupted or the disruptor. Good news: you get to choose. But you have to choose with purpose – and investment. Not every AI-driven change will be relevant to every software company – but many will be. Here are the things that I think increase the probability of surviving and thriving: AI woven in, not sprinkled on . Your product needs AI in its DNA, not just as a chatbot Band-Aid slapped on your help center. That's not innovation; that's decoration. Most software companies will need to reimagine their product in the age of AI and build towards that vision. Openness drives agility . Chances are, you've already built APIs for your product. Invest in those. Make the DX better and make them broader in scope. If your API documentation is a mess from years ago, now would be a good time to fix that. This strategy of being open was important before, it's critical now. The reason is that APIs not only allow you to expand your partner ecosystem and have others build value on your platform, but they also help you take your product more easily into new environments. Example: When we had the mobile revolution, the companies that had robust APIs were more easily able to offer mobile products. Interfaces for humans and agents . Deliver MCP (Model Context Protocol) support. Where APIs were primarily for human developers to build applications, integrations and extensions, MCPs are built primarily for AI apps and agents. You can start with wrapping some of your existing (REST) APIs – but don't stop there. Just like you wouldn't just take your web product and squeeze it onto a smaller mobile screen, you need to actually spend time designing your MCP interface so that it fits what agents will need and find useful. Avoid “One Pricing Model To Rule Them All”. Don't rely exclusively on a user/seat subscription model. Many AI products and features will likely be better suited for consumption or outcome-based models. But, don't just slap consumption pricing on whatever you can. Do what makes sense for your product and your market. Take customer service: companies know what resolution costs them and what success looks like. Perfect setup for outcome-based pricing. But not every use case is this clear-cut. Prepare for Hybrid/Fluid UIs . If you haven't already, start thinking about how all or parts of your product might benefit from a natural language interface (either text or voice chat). This may not make sense for all parts of your product – but definitely some of them. Things are moving quickly and when the tide does shift towards a new interface paradigm, your customers are going to expect you to be ready to move and ship quickly. Elevate your execution with AI . Your product is important but it's not everything. Your entire business should be leveraging AI to make your complete offering better for customers. Your sales team using AI to write better emails? Table stakes. Your product actually learning from every customer interaction and getting smarter? That's the game. Your GTM (marketing/sales) needs to get better. Your onboarding should be smarter and more fluid. Your customer support should be AI-powered. Every aspect of your business can benefit from AI and help you deliver higher value with lower friction. I know that's a lot. It's like being told you need to renovate your house while still living in it, during an earthquake. But here's the thing about transformations—they're transformative. And this isn’t just a playbook it’s the one we’re using at HubSpot . More on that coming up at our annual INBOUND conference in San Francisco. Why I'm Excited (And Why the Market Should Be Too) There's good news. The companies that can embrace the change and channel it stand to benefit from higher growth, happier customers and healthy economics. The thing I find most exciting about AI is that it lets us solve problems software couldn't solve before — messier, more open-ended, multi-step problems that need software that can think and reason..That doesn't shrink the software pie; it expands it. More problems solved means more value created, which means a bigger market for everyone who adapts. Startups, scaleups and grownups (incumbents) can benefit. SaaS expanded the market for software, because it delivered more value to customers by removing the friction of on-prem infrastructure and perpetual licenses. AI will create a much larger opportunity because we will be able to solve a much larger set of problems more efficiently and better. The companies that died during the SaaS transition weren't killed by the cloud—they were killed by their own inability to let go of their server rooms. Don't be the company clutching your old paradigms while your customers move on without you. So back to my central argument: AI won't kill the software industry, it'll catapult it. There has never been a better time to be building software. The tools are smarter, the problems we can solve are bigger, and for the first time in history, our code can actually help us write better code. I'm not just here for it—I'm building for it. Let’s do this!

software as a service. that was much less paradoxical  it's got the word ""software"" right there in the name. saas didn't kill software; saas was software  just in a different package. instead of running on premises, it was delivered over the internet, usually inside of a web browser. instead of having a perpetual license to the software as was common in the earlier generation, you could subscribe to software. instead of every company having its own databaseservers, etc. we had multi-tenancy whereby multiple companies often hundreds or thousands could run in the same infrastructure. this impacted the economics of the industry considerably. what saas did was elevate software by making things better for customers and also better for the software companies serving them. hold that thought  because history is about to rhyme. now, a quarter-century later, we're watching the same movie with a different cast. the doomsayers are back, the paradox is back, but this time the villain isn't on-prem softwareit's software itself. and once again, they're missing the plot twist. fast forward 25 years: enter ai, stage center at this point i don't need to make the case for ai being a transformative new technology. ai is arguably the most transformative technology since the internet itselfand unlike the internet, it doesn't just connect human intelligence, it amplifies it. ai isn't nibbling at the edges; it's rewriting the recipe across many industries. ai is reshaping software at every level: how we build it with coding agents like lovable and replit that turn developers into conductors rather than code typists, who can build it your marketing manager can now sketch a working app over lunch, and how it connects goodbye, point-to-point integrations; hello, model context protocol. even the business model is evolvingfrom seats to outcomes, from subscriptions to consumption. consider this: the global software market is approaching 1 trillion annually. if ai makes us just 2x more productive at solving problems, we're not looking at a smaller marketwe're looking at a multiples larger one. there's also a big change to how some software will be distributed. in the pre-ai world, most software capability was delivered through a web browser. in the future, it's conceivable that instead of running in a browser, more applications run inside an ai application like openai 's chatgpt which has over 700m weekly active users. to put that in perspective, that's more than 2x the population of the united states checking in with an ai every week. when was the last time any software platform grew that fast? hint: never. we're witnessing a platform shift as significant as mobile or the web itselfexcept this time, the platform thinks. so here's my point: there are definitely lots of changes happening. but, ai is not going to kill the software industry, it's going to kill software companies that don't adapt to the change. how to not get crushed so if you're a software company right now, you're probably wondering if you're the disrupted or the disruptor. good news: you get to choose. but you have to choose with purpose  and investment. not every ai-driven change will be relevant to every software company  but many will be. here are the things that i think increase the probability of surviving and thriving: ai woven in, not sprinkled on . your product needs ai in its dna, not just as a chatbot band-aid slapped on your help center. that's not innovation; that's decoration. most software companies will need to reimagine their product in the age of ai and build towards that vision. openness drives agility . chances are, you've already built apis for your product. invest in those. make the dx better and make them broader in scope. if your api documentation is a mess from years ago, now would be a good time to fix that. this strategy of being open was important before, it's critical now. the reason is that apis not only allow you to expand your partner ecosystem and have others build value on your platform, but they also help you take your product more easily into new environments. example: when we had the mobile revolution, the companies that had robust apis were more easily able to offer mobile products. interfaces for humans and agents . deliver mcp model context protocol support. where apis were primarily for human developers to build applications, integrations and extensions, mcps are built primarily for ai apps and agents. you can start with wrapping some of your existing rest apis  but don't stop there. just like you wouldn't just take your web product and squeeze it onto a smaller mobile screen, you need to actually spend time designing your mcp interface so that it fits what agents will need and find useful. avoid one pricing model to rule them all. don't rely exclusively on a userseat subscription model. many ai products and features will likely be better suited for consumption or outcome-based models. but, don't just slap consumption pricing on whatever you can. do what makes sense for your product and your market. take customer service: companies know what resolution costs them and what success looks like. perfect setup for outcome-based pricing. but not every use case is this clear-cut. prepare for hybridfluid uis . if you haven't already, start thinking about how all or parts of your product might benefit from a natural language interface either text or voice chat. this may not make sense for all parts of your product  but definitely some of them. things are moving quickly and when the tide does shift towards a new interface paradigm, your customers are going to expect you to be ready to move and ship quickly. elevate your execution with ai . your product is important but it's not everything. your entire business should be leveraging ai to make your complete offering better for customers. your sales team using ai to write better emails?

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"Companies love to exclaim “we’re data driven”. There are obvious benefits to being a data driven organization, and everyone nowadays has more data than they can shake a stick at. But what exactly does an organization need to be “data driven”? Just because you have a ton of data, and you’ve hired people to analyze it or build models, does that make you data driven? No. That’s not enough. Although we think a lot about data and how to use it. Being data driven needs to be a priority at the executive level and become part of the culture of the organization; more so than simply having a team with the necessary capabilities. Here are the baseline qualities that I believe are necessary to be effective in your “data driven-ness”. Now I’m making up words. TO BE DATA DRIVEN: Test design and analysis is owned by analytics/data science teams. Dashboards are already in place that give stakeholders self-serve access to key metrics. (Otherwise you’ll have low value ad-hoc requests to pull these metrics, and it’ll be a time sink.) Analytics/Data Science teams collaborate with the business to understand the problem and devise an appropriate methodology. Data governance and consistent usage of data definitions across departments/the organization. You have a data strategy. You’ll notice that there is a lack of fancy hype buzzwords above. You don’t need to be “leveraging AI” or calling things AI that are in fact hypothesis tests, business logic, or simple regression. I don’t believe fancy models are required to consider yourself data driven. A number of the points listed above are references to the attitudes of the organization and how they partner and collaborate with analytics and data science teams . I love building models as much as the next data scientist, but you can’t build next level intelligence on a non-existent foundation. To clarify, I’m not saying every decision in the organization needs to be driven by data to be data driven. In particular, if you’re going to make a strategic decision regardless of the results of a test or analysis, then you should skip doing that test. I’m a big advocate of only allocating the resources to a project if you’re actually going to USE the results to inform the decision. Let’s take a look at the points from above. TEST DESIGN AND ANALYSIS IS OWNED BY ANALYTICS/DATA SCIENCE TEAMS: Although data science and analytics teams often come up with fantastic ideas for testing. There are also many ideas that come out of a department that is not in analytics. For instance, in eCommerce the marketing team will have many ideas for new offers. The site team may want to test a change to the UI. This sometimes gets communicated to the data teams as “we’d like to test “this thing, this way”. And although these non analytics teams have tremendous skill in marketing and site design, and understand the power of an A/B test; they often do not understand the different trade-offs between effect size, sample size, solid test design, etc. I’ve been in the situation more than once at more than one company where I’m told “we understand your concerns, but we’re going to do it our way anyways.” And this is their call to make, since in these instances those departments have technically “owned” test design. However, the data resulting from these tests is often not able to be analyzed. So although we did it their way, the ending result did not answer any questions. Time was wasted. DASHBOARDING IS IN PLACE: This is a true foundational step. So much time is wasted if you have analysts pulling the same numbers every month manually, or on an ad-hoc basis. This information can be automated, stakeholders can be given a tour of the dashboards, and then you won’t be receiving questions like “what does attrition look like month over month by acquisition channel?” It’s in the dashboard and stakeholders can look at it themselves. The time saved can be allocated to diving deep into much more interesting and though provoking questions rather than pulling simple KPIs. ANALYTICS/DATA SCIENCE TEAMS COLLABORATE WITH THE BUSINESS ON DEFINING THE PROBLEMS: This relationship takes work, because it is a relationship. Senior leaders need to make it clear that a data-driven approach is a priority for this to work. In addition, analytics often needs to invite themselves to meetings that they weren’t originally invited to. Analytics needs to be asking the right questions and guiding analysis in the right direction to earn this seat at the table. No relationship builds over night, but this is a win-win for everyone. Nothing is more frustrating than pulling data when you’re not sure what problem the business is trying to solve. It’s Pandoras Box. You pull the data they asked for, it doesn’t answer the question, so the business asks you to pull them more data. Stop. Sit down, discuss the problem, and let the business know that you’re here to help. DATA GOVERNANCE AND CONSISTENT USAGE OF DATA DEFINITIONS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS/THE ORGANIZATION: This one may require a huge overhaul of how things are currently being calculated. The channel team, the product team, the site team, other teams, they may all be calculating things differently if the business hasn’t communicated an accepted definition. These definitions aren’t necessarily determined by analytics themselves, they’re agreed upon. For an established business that has done a lot of growing but not as much governance can feel the pain of trying to wrangle everyone into using consistent definitions. But if two people try to do the same analysis and come up with different numbers you’ve got problems. This is again a foundation that is required for you to be able to move forward and work on cooler higher-value projects, but can’t if you’re spending your time reconciling numbers between teams. YOU HAVE A DATA STRATEGY: This data strategy is going to be driven by the business strategy. The strategy is going to have goals and be measurable. The analyses you plan for has a strong use case. People don’t just come out of the woodwork asking for analysis that doesn’t align to the larger priorities of the business. Things like “do we optimize our ad spend or try to tackle our retention problem first?” comes down to expected dollars for the business. Analytics doesn’t get side-tracked answering lower value questions when they should be working on the problems that will save the business the most money. IN SUMMARY: I hope you found this article helpful. Being data driven will obviously help you to make better use of your data. However, becoming data driven involves putting processes into place and having agreement about who owns what at the executive level. It’s worth it, but it doesn’t happen over night. If you’re not yet data driven, I wish you luck on your journey to get there. Your analysts and data scientists will thank you. If you have suggestions on what else is required to be data driven, please let me know your thoughts!

ybernstein,"The following is a lightly edited version of an email I sent my team about code review. We use git pull requests, but most of what I write applies to any form of code review, especially offline (as opposed to in-person) pre-commit review. Being a code reviewer is a duty and a trust. When you hit “approve” on a pull request, you are making a declaration that you are comfortable that the code belongs in your codebase in its current form. If there is anything about the request that makes you uncomfortable (e.g. no unit tests!), you are duty-bound to raise that concern. That doesn’t mean being unnecessarily nitpicky or combative, but it does mean that you shouldn’t avoid raising a concern out of expediency or because you think the feedback won’t be well received. More eyes are always better, and there is precious little code that can’t be improved by having another person look over it and make suggestions. As a reviewer, this is your job. For this to work, it is important that everybody also receives review feedback in a spirit of goodwill. When your reviewer comes back to you with feedback or requests for changes, they are not doing this to attack you or shame you or stand in the way of you getting your work done. They are doing it to fulfil their duty as a reviewer. If you have a problem with the way your code in being critiqued, please don’t make your reviewer uncomfortable. You are welcome to come to me to discuss it, but I am likely to give them a fair bit of benefit of the doubt. Understanding that code criticism is not personal criticism forms a key part of egoless programming. I know the concept of duty is an old-fashioned one, but I think it captures the act of code reviewing perfectly. Reviewing code is not always going to be fun or convenient, but if done correctly it can be the key tool to ensuring we have a codebase that we can be proud of. Great code is everybody’s responsibility, and it can only happen if the whole team works together to uphold high standards. Here are some tips for making your code easy to review: -Descriptive titles and code descriptions. I think we’re most of the way there, thanks everybody! -Small, atomic changes. This makes it much quicker and easier for a reviewer to understand (and hence get comfortable) with a change. It’s possible (and in many cases preferable) for a single PBI to generate multiple PRs. Atomic means not able to be broken down further: each PR should do a small number of self-contained things, and subsequent PRs can build on earlier ones. Git makes this pretty easy. Tip: If it takes more than a couple of sentences to describe your PR, consider whether it is truly atomic or should be broken down further. -Tests. One of the many wonderful things about tests is that they act as a form of documentation. Adding tests to your PR will make your change much easier to review. And here are some tips for being a good reviewer: -Quick turnarounds. You don’t have to drop everything when a PR comes in, but don’t keep the requestor hanging for any longer than necessary. -Minimise round-trips. That means getting all your feedback out in a single pass rather than making people go through multiple rounds. -Meaningful comments.

dharmesh,"One thing we’ve learned at HubSpot is that we’re building two products. One is a product for our customers (our software) and the second is a product for our people (our culture). Just as you want to attract and retain customers, you want to attract and retain the best people. What are the best people looking for in a company today? Lots of things, but very high on the list is flexibility . Specifically, where, when, and how they work. So, why do so many employers still fear flexible working? The evidence for being pro-flexibility is strong. 80% of U.S. workers say they would turn down a job that didn’t offer flexible working . And, 34% would take a paycut up to 5% in order to work remotely. In other words, when you focus on results over the number of hours worked, or where, they are worked, you let the best people do their best work. Last year at HubSpot’s annual INBOUND event (26,000+ people!), I spoke about flexibility, remote work and introduced a new business principle called the “Pajama Principle.” It states that success is proportional to the degree to which you let people stay in their pajamas. While pajamas might not be conducive to productivity for everyone, the heart of the principle I think remains the same. People do their best work when the circumstances -- time and place -- are optimal for them . The traditional workplace environment doesn’t necessarily work for everyone. That’s why I live by this principle - both as a beneficiary (I work from home a fair amount of the time) and as an advocate for its implementation within the company. Since the very early days at HubSpot, my-founder, Brian Halligan and I have been committed to flexibility, and we’ve had people working remotely for over 10 years. More recently, we’ve been focused on building a great experience and culture for our remote community. I’ll admit it hasn't been easy and we have a long way to go, but we've made progress. Today, we have over 300 full-time remote employees, we have a remote-specific careers page , and if we combine all the people who work remotely - full time and part time - the living room (or whatever room people work in) would be the biggest HubSpot office. Why is flexibility and remote work still a foreign concept for so many? People worry a lot about communication, productivity and results. They wonder about the values, behaviors, and working styles of remote employees and assume their culture will have to change to accommodate. Our first-ever Remote Work Report found that remote workers are in fact not a different species, but just like the rest of us. Who knew?! They drink coffee (on average two cups a day), they listen to music at least an hour a day, and over half (55%) of them have at least one pet. (The other half are good people too, just with less cuddlines in their lives -- can’t have everything). What we also found was that employers can better support the distributed workforce. 29% of remote workers surveyed noted a lack of social connection and communication with co-workers as the two biggest challenges they face being remote. With Upwork’s “Future Workforce Report” predicting that 73% of all teams will have remote workers by 2028 , it’s critical that we focus on building better remote communities. Remember, remote people are people, too. Treat them with the same respect as you do with in-office colleagues, and you’ll dramatically open up the pool of possible talent.

ybernstein,"Ownership is a state of mind. It is a fire in your belly. Ownership drives a laser focus on delivering valuable outcomes for the business. Autonomy and accountability both factor into this. Set lofty goals, work hard to come up with an optimised plan, demand the autonomy and resources needed to achieve those goals. Advocacy to leadership is a key part of having ownership. Things that individuals and teams with a true sense of ownership have: A sense of urgency. All your work counts for nothing until it is delivering value. Therefore, a true sense of ownership also drives a sense of urgency. Teams with a sense of ownership can’t wait to start delivering value to their users and their business. This impatience should drive a ruthless desire for efficiency within the team, a bias towards delivery, and a hunger for learning. However, a sense of urgency does not and should not mean burning oneself out, nor does it mean taking damaging shortcuts. High expectations of each other. Your team’s success is your success, and your team cannot succeed unless all functions are doing their jobs well. Therefore having low expectations of others is equivalent to having low expectations of yourself. Teams with a sense of ownership generate “Good” pressure. Bad pressure comes from outside the team. Bad pressure causes stress and fatigue. Bad pressure is a crushing force and makes a team smaller . Good pressure comes from inside a team, and makes it bigger . It creates energy and motivation, a sense of agency. Think of a balloon, or a tyre. Pressure from within is what allows them to take shape and perform their job. Without pressure they are flaccid and useless. A sense of ownership generates good pressure. Owners escalate frequently. Teams that are driven to deliver value do not tolerate obstacles that stand in the way of doing so. Those that they can remove themselves, they remove themselves. Other obstacles are escalated to their leaders for swift resolution. Obstacles come in many forms: under-resourcing, lack of clarity, missing context, inability to reach a decision, and more.

stephaniehillsphd,"We all have dreams, goals, and aspirations—but how often do we delay taking action? Years ago, I had big ambitions to start my own business to help others in their career. I found myself stuck in a cycle of overthinking. I kept telling myself, “I’ll start when I’m ready.” But ready never came. Instead, weeks turned into months, and months into years. Opportunities slipped away—not because I lacked ability, but because I hesitated. Sound familiar? Maybe you’ve been meaning to launch that business, apply for that leadership role, or start building your personal brand. But something keeps holding you back—the fear of failure, the endless search for the “perfect” time, or the voice in your head whispering, “What if I’m not good enough?” The real enemy? Procrastination. It disguises itself as preparation and perfectionism , but in reality, it’s just a thief stealing your future. It keeps you comfortable but costs you progress. It convinces you that tomorrow is better—but tomorrow never comes. 🔥 Here’s the truth: Success doesn’t wait for you to be ready. The most successful people take action before they feel prepared. They move despite the fear. They build momentum, one imperfect step at a time. If you want to change your life, start today. Not tomorrow. Not someday. Now. Take one step forward, no matter how small. Send that email. Make that call. Start that project. 🚨 3 Easy Ways to Beat Procrastination & Take Back Control Every Day ✅ The 5-Minute Rule – If a task feels overwhelming, commit to doing it for just 5 minutes. Action kills anxiety. Once you start, the resistance fades, and you’ll feel the relief of progress instead of the guilt of delay . ✅ Future Pain vs. Present Pain – Ask yourself: How will I feel if I don’t do this? Imagine the regret, stress, and frustration of staying stuck. Now flip it—picture the confidence, momentum, and freedom you’ll feel when it’s done. Choose progress over regret. ✅ Make It Public – Tell someone your goal. Accountability forces action. When you follow through, you gain pride and self-trust instead of the shame of broken promises to yourself . 🔥 Every time you delay, you make the pain of inaction stronger. But every time you act, you widen the gap between your old, stuck self and your new, unstoppable self . 🔥 Procrastination is the assassination of your destination.

abidalee,"‘An empty vessel makes the loudest sound’ -- Plato Knowledgeable people are often humble and consider themselves the least knowledgeable among others. Such people have the benefit of learning the most from others. To the contrary, people who believe they know it all, lose a greater opportunity to learn from others. It is necessary to ‘listen’ more than ‘talk’. We can never learn enough as the learning continues a life time. Unfortunately, we live in a competitive world and the life around us is constantly evolving. Several new things are invented every day. In order to play along the competition, it is necessary to stay abreast of the new trends and emerging technologies.

Embracing AI isn’t just about adopting new technology — it’s about managing the pace of change and empowering the people who drive it.

caseybhawkins,"🔥 TOP 5 HUBSPOT UPDATES FROM FEBRUARY 17, 2026 🔥 We're back! A few days off from the show and HubSpot dropped twenty-four updates on us. Chris had some technical difficulties getting the stream going this morning, George and I held it down for about 30 seconds, and then we were off to the races. Twenty-four updates is a LOT to cover, and honestly? Picking just five was tough. There are some heavy hitters in this batch. Here's what made the cut, but check out the blog for the full breakdown on all twenty-four. Here's what dropped: ⚙️ Add Line Items to Deals via Workflow Actions (Request Beta) This one is huge. You can now select a product from your library, set a quantity, and automatically attach line items to deals when a workflow fires. No more manual deal setup or custom-coded actions. Chris called out that this replaces a ton of custom code people have been maintaining, and he's right. 👉 Request beta: https://hubs.li/Q043nyLv0 🎯 Conditional Scoring with ""and"" for Lead Scores AND Health Scores (Live) Finally. Scoring rules now support compound ""and"" criteria, so you can award points only when multiple conditions are met. I've been waiting for this one. One caveat: the ""and"" rules are within a single action type right now, so cross-object conditions (like form submission + job title) still need a list or workflow. But this is a major step. 👉 Learn more: https://hubs.li/Q043nwPb0 📋 Enhanced Multi-Step Form Logic (Beta) New hide and show step-level actions let you dynamically control which steps visitors see based on their responses. Skip to Step is deprecated, and if all remaining steps get hidden, the Submit button surfaces automatically. George's reaction: ""Getting pretty powerful over there with the forms."" 👉 Join beta: https://hubs.li/Q043nry20 🔄 Workflow CRM Property Data Restore (Beta, Enterprise) If a workflow accidentally updates thousands of records with the wrong value, you can now undo those changes within fourteen days. Built on HubSpot's unified backup system. This is the safety net ops teams have needed. 👉 Join beta: https://hubs.li/Q043nyTW0 🔍 Granular Filter Insights in Segments (Beta) You can now see exactly how each filter shapes your segment as you build it, in real time. Zero-match filters get flagged. No more saving, checking, tweaking, saving again. 👉 Join beta: https://hubs.li/Q043nw650 The theme today? Confidence. Scoring with precision, building segments with transparency, restoring data after mistakes, and automating deal setup without manual cleanup. The tools are getting smarter AND safer. Which update are you testing first? Catch Chris Carolan, George B.

dharmesh,"There's a big mistake I make as a public speaker. It's a mistake I think many amateurs make that the pros usually don't. The mistake is that I'm hesitant to reuse and refine content/messages I've used in prior talks. I feel like I need to create fresh, never-before-shared content for every speaking gig. But, that's not the right way to go about it. If you're solving for the audience (which you should be), then ask yourself what would be most useful/impactful. Trying a new set of messages/content for each audience, or refining and iterating on the most important messages you have and making those better? I think there's power in repetition and refinement. Keep polishing the message and the idea so it's easier to absorb, easier to apply, easier for others to share. That's a much better use of time than trying to just conjure up new material every single time. Also, the audience is never the same, even if it's exactly the same people a few months later. Even if your material hasn't changed they have likely changed and it's not a waste of their time to hear some parts again. They may see things from a different perspective.

stephaniehillsphd,"I had COVID. And it hit hard. Not just physically—but mentally and emotionally. Six weeks of being down and out. And even when I “recovered,” I didn’t feel like myself. Covid fatigue lingered. Some days I felt great. Other days, just walking around felt like a win. But in the stillness, something powerful happened… 🤔 I had an epiphany. I wasn't going to let COVID win, yet I didn’t want to just get back to how things were. Because how things were wasn’t really working. My life before was full. Busy. “Successful.” But it was all about doing . Checking boxes. Managing everyone else’s needs. But never really putting myself first, my needs, my MUSTS. Always productive—but rarely present. And I realized: I had been leaving myself out of my own life. 😱 ❓Is this you? 🚫 You’re always “on.” 🚫 You show up for everyone—but barely for yourself. 🚫 Your to-do list runs your day. 🚫 You move fast, but never feel fulfilled. 🚫 You feel guilty if you pause. 🚫 But exhausted if you don’t. 🚫 You keep thinking you’ll get to you… later. 🚫 But later never comes. Because you’ve been wired to serve, succeed, and survive. Not to slow down , heal , or be . And here’s the problem... The world praises overachievers. 🚫 We applaud people who grind through fatigue. 🚫 We normalize skipping sleep, numbing emotions, and “powering through.” But no one talks about how that lifestyle eats away at your health, your joy, and your identity—until something forces you to stop. Until your body says no more. Until your mind can’t focus. Until your soul feels distant. We’ve been conditioned to hustle through the warning signs. To believe rest is weak. To wear exhaustion like a badge of honor. 💪 What I decided instead? That moment when I realized I had been leaving myself out of my own life changed me. I decided I wasn’t going back to the old version of my life. 🎉 I wanted to live with intent. 🎉 To be present —for myself, for my sons, and for the life I still had ahead. So I rebuilt my days from a new foundation. Not around urgency. But around alignment . 🔺 The Wellness Triangle: My New Non-Negotiable I returned to the basics, the things that really matter: 🧠 Mind 🏋️♀️ Body 🌱 Soul ✅ Every day, I nourish all three: Mental Priming to clear my thoughts and set my intention Pilates + Cardio to strengthen and energize my body Hydration —water, water, water Eating Healthy —whole foods, no processed oils, plant-based proteins, smaller meals Presence —truly showing up with the people I love Gratitude, Faith, and Joy —because my soul needs nourishment too Then I zoomed out even further... 🌱 The 7 Elements of a Fulfilled Life Once I rebuilt my foundation around the Wellness Triangle —Mind, Body, and Soul—I realized there was more to balance than just personal health. Living with intention means being present and on purpose in every part of life that matters. ❓I thought, what are the elements of my life that really matter? Here are the 7 core elements where you can show up, engage, and experience fulfillment . These are the areas where we invest our time, energy, and heart. ✅ And while you might not give all of them equal time every day, you can make space for them all consistently. 1. Relationships / Community 🤝 Quality time, emotional presence, & love. This is where connection lives. The people we care about. The ones we show up for—and who show up for us. 2. Work / Career / Mission 💼 Meaningful impact that aligns with your purpose. We all want to build something that matters. Fulfillment comes when your work reflects your values and your gifts. 3. Health & Energy 💪 Movement, nourishment & feeling your best. This is the fuel that powers everything. It’s not about perfection—it’s about feeling strong, energized, and well. 4. Faith / Spirituality 🙏 Trust, gratitude & connection. This is your inner compass. Whether it’s through faith, prayer, or quiet reflection—it’s what keeps you grounded in something deeper. 5. Growth & Learning 📘 Curiosity, growth & becoming your best. When we grow, we feel alive. Stretching your mind and expanding your skills keeps life exciting and evolving. 6. Giving 🌍 Helping others, paying it forward with heart. Whether it’s mentoring, supporting, or simply showing up—giving is how we live beyond ourselves. 7. Fun & Adventure 🎉 Laughter, travel & joy. Play matters. So does exploration. Make space for what makes you feel alive. → When these 7 elements are honored—not perfectly, but intentionally—you begin to feel aligned. Not pulled in every direction. Not surviving, but thriving . 🔥 Final Thoughts ✨ It’s not about balance. It’s about making space for what truly matters.The life you want isn’t found in the hustle—it’s built in the balance. 1️⃣ Be WELL . Honor your mind. Care for your body. Feed your soul. ❤️🩹 2️⃣ FULFULL all the areas of your life, Relationships/Community, Work/Career/Mission, Giving, Fun & Adventure, Growth & Learning, Health & Energy, Faith & Spirituality 🎉 This changed my life.

dalianaliu,"Only 1% of LinkedIn users post regularly. 99% are missing out on opportunities because ""self-promotion"" sounds like a dirty word. They worry colleagues will judge them. That friends will roll their eyes. That their content will be met with silence—or worse, ridicule. So what? Those people aren't your audience anyway. Even if 99% ignore your post, but just 1% find it useful or inspiring, you're making an impact. You're planting seeds for future opportunities. You don't need a huge audience to attract high-quality opportunities — you just need the right people to discover your unique perspective: • More visibility in the job market • Conference speaking invitations • A potential customer base for future ventures Even if you want to ""self-promote,"" there's nothing wrong with that. You worked hard for your achievements. Share what makes you proud! Here's the truth: if you only care about your image, you'll fail at this. The best ""self-promotion"" benefits others: • Explaining complex concepts in plain language • Sharing unique opinions that help others avoid mistakes • Being vulnerable about struggles that make people feel seen and understood Remember this: you'll never fully live your own life while obsessing over what exists only in other people's minds. Worried nobody will read your post? That fear is normal. Most content gets minimal engagement at first. But what if one person reads it and wants to work with you? That single connection could change everything. Your voice matters. The world needs your unique perspective, and someone out there is waiting to hear exactly what you have to say. --- Want to build your personal brand in 2026?

kristen-kehrer-datamovesme,"I often see similar questions in my inbox or asked in webinars. I’d like to set the record straight with data. However, I didn’t need to start from scratch, there was an excellent article on KD Nuggets by Jeff Hale. Here is the link to his article: “The Most in Demand Skills for Data Scientists”. He had already scoured multiple job search site and aggregated data on the demand for different skills for data scientist. I recreated some of his analysis myself, so that I could come up with some points for this article, and to make sure his numbers matched mine before posting. The charts I created below are based on data from searches on indeed.com only. A search for “Data Scientist” was the denominator, and the numerator would be “Data Scientist” plus another term I was looking to see results for. I’m not sure how many job descriptions listed on indeed.com might be duplicates, so this is not gospel, but still interesting. This article will cover a couple of “Frequently Asked Questions” using the methodology above (that was adopted from Jeff). Questions I’m frequently asked: Should I learn R or Python? As a Computer Science major, can I get into data science? How important is SQL? Should I learn R or Python? This would most likely be the most frequently asked question (although I’ve never analyzed the questions that I’m asked). In Jeff’s article, you were able to see that Python has the edge in terms of coming up in job listings. I recreated the methodology for myself to look at this a little further. 55% of the job listings actually list both tools, as in the company would like to see that you have experience with “Python and/or R”. That should make those who have a preference for one tool feel better. If you’re looking to pick up either R or Python and you’re just getting your hands dirty, I’d suggest python. For listings that only specify one tool, Python is almost 5x more likely to be listed as the tool of choice compared to R. I was happy to see this, as I’ve mentioned in a number of webinars and comments on social media that it “feels like” Python is slightly more popular. It would have been a bummer if I had been giving misinformation this whole time. % of Data Science Positions Mentioning a Particular Skill on Indeed.com Pulled this data by doing a search on indeed.com 11/2018 As a Computer Science major, can I get into data science? I’m always surprised when I see this question, because as someone who’s been in the field for a long time, it just seems clear that this is a fantastic skill as your foundation for moving into data science. Data science requires a number of different skills to be successful, and being able to program is definitely one of the core pillars. Analytics and Statistics are coming in first, but Analytics and Statistics could easily be mentioned somewhere in the job description other than specifically where preferred degrees are mentioned. If a job description says “computer science” they’re most likely speaking to the degrees they would prefer from candidates. More than 50% of job descriptions mention “computer science”. There you have it, a degree in computer science is something “in demand” for getting into data science. % of Data Science Positions Mentioning a Particular Skill on Indeed.com Pulled this data by doing a search on indeed.com 11/2018 How important is SQL? I’m frequently asked this question, and I was honestly surprised that SQL came in third behind Python and R in terms of skills. However, 51% of jobs do mention SQL. So it is certainly desired for the majority of positions, but I expected it to rank higher. Is it possible this skill is becoming assumed as a prerequisite? Or are companies figuring that SQL is easily learned and therefore not necessary to list on the job description? I wouldn’t mind a job where all the datasets were aggregated for me before data cleaning and applying machine learning, I’m just not sure how many of those jobs exist. If you’re a data scientist, and you haven’t had to understand relational databases at any point, let me know. I’d love to hear about it. Conclusion: We saw that Python is preferred over R, but that either tool will allow you to apply to the majority of data science jobs in the US. Computer science degrees are a great stepping stone to getting into data science, and the majority of listings will expect you to know SQL. I also want to point out that “communication” was very much in the top list of skills. 46% of job descriptions listed communication in the job description. This means I’ll continue to keep writing about how I use softer skills to be effective in my job. I think we sometimes do not talk about communication enough in data science, it’s really imperative to delivering models and analysis that are aligned with what the business is looking for.

stephaniehillsphd,"When I was in my tech exec role, I looked successful on paper. Big title. Big team. Global projects. But deep down? I felt boxed in. Meetings that didn’t matter. Metrics that didn’t move me. And a constant tug in my chest that whispered, “This isn’t it.” I kept asking myself, “What’s the next role?” “What promotion should I chase?” But every step up just felt like more pressure—never more purpose. Until I stopped chasing the next title… And started designing the life I actually wanted. You don’t start reevaluating their career because you have a 10-step plan. You do it because you're done . 😱 Done feeling stuck. 😱 Done being overlooked or underpaid. 😱 Done living on someone else’s schedule. 😱 Done wondering, “Is this really it?” You don’t always know what they want next— You just know: Something has to change. So you start searching… ➡️ You scroll LinkedIn. ➡️ You update your resume. ➡️ You ask ChatGPT: “What’s the best career to go into in 2025?” And the internet answers: ❗️Go into tech. ❗️Try product management. ❗️Start consulting. ❗️Become a coach. ❗️Get certified. ❗️Pivot to AI. Whatever’s trending this week. So you pick something. ✔ Apply for roles. ✔ Maybe even get promoted. ✔ Land the job. But a few months in? That old feeling creeps back in. 😱 Still stuck. 😱 Still unfulfilled. 😱 Still not living the life you imagined. You changed the job... But not the approach. Here’s why that happens: Because you started with the wrong question. You asked: “What role will get me ahead?” Instead of: “What kind of life do I want—and what path gets me there?” One leads to the next title. The other leads to long-term freedom, growth, and purpose. Because the right next move? Isn’t always a new job. It’s not always a promotion. And it’s definitely not whatever the algorithm is pushing. 🔥 It’s alignment. 🔥 Between who you are and how you show up in your work. Your career isn’t just a ladder. It’s a vehicle . A way to create the life you want to live. But you have to know what that life looks like first. So instead of asking: “What should I do next?” Start asking: ⁉️ How do I want to wake up every day? ⁉️ What kind of work energizes me? ⁉️ What kind of problems do I love solving? ⁉️ What kind of people do I want to work with? ⁉️ What would my career look like if it bent around my life—not the other way around? Because once you answer that… ⚡️ The clarity shows up. ⚡️ The right roles become obvious. ⚡️ The growth becomes sustainable. ⚡️ And the fulfillment becomes real. Not because you followed the trend— But because you followed your truth. So what’s it going to be? Another title that looks good on paper but leaves you drained? Or a path that gives you the IMPACT, FREEDOM, MEANING you’ve been craving? 💪 Once you choose you , you get to choose everything else. Why did I write this? I’ve been hearing from so many professionals lately— People who are brilliant, capable, experienced— But stuck in decision loops. Debating between titles. Overthinking every option. Trying to guess what will finally feel right. But clarity doesn’t come from a job title. It comes from you . So I wrote this to shift the conversation. Back to what actually matters. So you stop building your career from pressure, comparison, or “shoulds”… And start creating from alignment, purpose, and real inner clarity. Because that’s where the momentum lives. That’s where the MAGIC happens. 💫 Need a place to start? ✅ Try this: “Remind Me Who I Am” Career Prompt (ChatGPT) “Act as a motivational coach who helps people get clarity—not by telling me what to do, but by helping me remember who I am. Guide me through a powerful reflection to reconnect with: 🔷 What I actually want from life 🔷 What kind of work lights me up 🔷 The kind of days I want to live 🔷 What I’ve been afraid to admit I want 🔷 What kind of role I’d pursue if I stopped chasing approval and started trusting myself Ask me deep questions, push past surface answers, and reflect back what you see in me—and what’s possible if I stop playing small.” 🚀 Your next move isn’t in a job board.

stephaniehillsphd,"Back in college, I waited tables to make ends meet. I was fast, sharp, and proud of how I handled things under pressure. But one day, I noticed the other waitresses whispering. I finally asked, “What’s up? Why are y’all always talking about me?” One of them looked me straight in the eye and said: “You’re really smart. But every time something goes wrong, you make excuses instead of owning it.” 😱 That hit me hard. They were right. I thought being smart meant I always had an answer. But smart isn’t the same as being a problem solver . 👉 Ever been in that position? 👉 When things go wrong, do you explain… or do you take action? 👉 Do you try to protect your ego, or do you focus on fixing the problem? The truth is— your value isn’t always in what you know. It’s in how you solve problems. From that day forward, I changed how I showed up—at work, in life, in leadership. I became solution-focused, and it completely shifted my growth trajectory. 🔥 10 Steps to Become a World-Class Problem Solver 🔥 1️⃣ Own the problem. Don’t blame. Don’t deflect. Take responsibility, even if it’s not entirely yours. Be the ""top cover"" for your team to own the problem with the ""buck stops here"" attitude. 2️⃣ Stay calm in the crisis. Emotion clouds judgment. Leaders breathe, then lead. Your emotional temperature sets the environment for the rest of the team. 3️⃣ Listen and Learn. Talk to the people closest to the problem—your team, your customers, your peers. Listen deeply to better understand the issue and collaborate for the best solutions. When problems together, the team owns the solution. 4️⃣ Define the root cause. Most people solve the symptom, not the root. Ask “Why?” five times. Also ask, what can we do to prevent this from happening again or how can we make it better? 5️⃣ Break it down. Large problems become manageable when you split them into steps. 6️⃣ Get curious, not critical. Replace judgment with questions. “What can we learn?” opens doors. 7️⃣ Use constraints to create clarity. Limited time or resources can lead to the most innovative ideas. 8️⃣ Communicate clearly. Great problem solvers explain the issue and the solution simply. As Einstein said ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" 9️⃣ Take fast action. Don’t wait for perfect. Move forward with a clear direction and adjust as you go. 🔟 Reflect and Pivot. What worked? What didn’t? Build a playbook for next time. ⚡️ Smart people know the answers. Problem solvers create the outcomes. ⚡️ ⁉️ What is your tip to be a ""world-class"" problem solver? ♻ Repost to encourage your network to inspire others. ➕ Follow me ( Stephanie Hills, Ph.D. ) for more like this. #freedomseekers #careerfreedom #leadershipdevelopment # leadershipdevelopment #cultureofinnovation",7.0,0.0,332,,38166,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],23,8,"['😱', '👉', '👉', '👉', '🔥', '🔥', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '️', '🔟', '⚡', '️', '⚡', '️', '️', '♻', '➕']",4,"['#freedomseekers', '#careerfreedom', '#leadershipdevelopment', '#cultureofinnovation']",2767,2698,476,462,62,11,0,0,"back in college, i waited tables to make ends meet. i was fast, sharp, and proud of how i handled things under pressure. but one day, i noticed the other waitresses whispering. i finally asked, whats up? why are yall always talking about me? one of them looked me straight in the eye and said: youre really smart. but every time something goes wrong, you make excuses instead of owning it. that hit me hard. they were right. i thought being smart meant i always had an answer. but smart isnt the same as being a problem solver . ever been in that position? when things go wrong, do you explain or do you take action? do you try to protect your ego, or do you focus on fixing the problem? the truth is your value isnt always in what you know. its in how you solve problems. from that day forward, i changed how i showed upat work, in life, in leadership. i became solution-focused, and it completely shifted my growth trajectory. 10 steps to become a world-class problem solver 1 own the problem. dont blame. dont deflect. take responsibility, even if its not entirely yours. be the ""top cover"" for your team to own the problem with the ""buck stops here"" attitude. 2 stay calm in the crisis. emotion clouds judgment. leaders breathe, then lead. your emotional temperature sets the environment for the rest of the team. 3 listen and learn. talk to the people closest to the problemyour team, your customers, your peers. listen deeply to better understand the issue and collaborate for the best solutions. when problems together, the team owns the solution. 4 define the root cause. most people solve the symptom, not the root. ask why? five times. also ask, what can we do to prevent this from happening again or how can we make it better? 5 break it down. large problems become manageable when you split them into steps. 6 get curious, not critical. replace judgment with questions. what can we learn? opens doors. 7 use constraints to create clarity. limited time or resources can lead to the most innovative ideas. 8 communicate clearly. great problem solvers explain the issue and the solution simply. as einstein said ""if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" 9 take fast action. dont wait for perfect. move forward with a clear direction and adjust as you go. reflect and pivot. what worked? what didnt? build a playbook for next time. smart people know the answers. problem solvers create the outcomes.  what is your tip to be a ""world-class"" problem solver? repost to encourage your network to inspire others. follow me  stephanie hills, ph.d.  for more like this. #freedomseekers #careerfreedom #leadershipdevelopment # leadershipdevelopment #cultureofinnovation",-15,too_long,"back in college, i waited tables to make ends meet",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,6,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,12,3,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,73,73

davidlowjw,"It’s been a fun but honestly pretty hectic past two weeks. I just wrapped up the AI Telco RCA challenge[1], travelled to Bali for my nephew’s wedding, and unexpectedly found myself reliving memories of my own Bali wedding 14 years ago. Somewhere in between all that, I was also honoured to be named one of the ""Top AI Leaders to Watch"". Thank you #Traicon and #AIRevolutionSummit for the recognition. Still feels a bit surreal. All this somehow made me reflect on my own “vibe coding” journey. It started early last year when I saw Andrej talking about vibe coding on X. Out of curiosity, I jumped in. First starting with a ChatGPT, then GitHub Copilot, and eventually Cursor AI IDE. I was actually quite an early Cursor user. To the Cursor folks who reached out for feedback… sorry, I never got back to you. Work has been intense, and I’ve mostly been using it for side projects. Those side projects turned out to be pretty fun though. I built crypto trading algos (intra-minute and swing trading), a web app that generates 3D models for my wife’s 3D printing business, and eventually used vibe coding to join the Zindi challenge to build a telco RCA LLM. Naturally, the conversation has shifted from if AI Agents can replace coders to when that might actually happen. Sam Altman has even suggested that we may soon see a one-person startup reaching unicorn status powered entirely by AI agents without hiring a single human. As an AI/ML practitioner, that sparked my curiosity to explore whether AI agents could perform my work autonomously. I decided to use the Zindi challenge as a litmus test. Short answer is No. Not yet. But here’s the teaser. It did help us get into the top 10 on the leaderboard in one of the track. I’ll share more in a follow up post on how I vibe coded my way there, where LLMs really shine, and where the real bottlenecks still are. At this point, I don’t even think of it as “coding with vibes” anymore.

dharmesh,"One thing that's been on my mind a lot lately: Is a purely chat-based interface the optimal UI for humans to work with AI? As much as I love natural language interfaces provided by ChatUX, there are many use cases where there are better, more efficient ways to interact. I think the future is going to be about hybrid, fluid UI. A combination of chat and other more ""classic"" UI that we're used to. Here's what I'm experimenting with as a very rudimentary approach to incorporating some ""classic"" UI into a chat interface: Expose the ability for the LLM to request user inputs (of varying kinds) as ""tools"" or (functions). This ability for LLMs to use tools is a Very Big Deal -- but in most cases, we're using these tools to do back-end integrations, call APIs and access data. But we can take tool use much further. We can give LLMs tools that allow human input. For example, if the LLM needs to get a date from the user, it uses the tool to get that input, and we show an inline UI control for the user to enter a date. That control could allow natural language input (next Monday) or a popup calendar. Similarly, we could support all the UI primitives that are common (text input, dropdown selection, etc.) Not the fanciest of UIs, but even with the basic primitives, there's a lot we can do. And, I like how it keeps orchestration power in the hands of the LLM and lets it worry about when human input might be required and a way to get it. Over time, we could expand that model with more powerful UI controls (grids, visualizers, image editors, etc.) I can also conceive of a way to get human input asynchronously (for longer-running tasks). For example we could have a ""send_user_approval_link_by_email"". This would send the user an email with a link to approve/continue the agentic workflow. There are likely much better ways to blend the UI, but this one has the value that it could actually be implemented by mere mortals like me, and it would be a step in the right direction.",323.0,76.0,293,,1174428,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],1987,1969,360,360,19,1,0,0,"one thing that's been on my mind a lot lately: is a purely chat-based interface the optimal ui for humans to work with ai? as much as i love natural language interfaces provided by chatux, there are many use cases where there are better, more efficient ways to interact. i think the future is going to be about hybrid, fluid ui. a combination of chat and other more ""classic"" ui that we're used to. here's what i'm experimenting with as a very rudimentary approach to incorporating some ""classic"" ui into a chat interface: expose the ability for the llm to request user inputs of varying kinds as ""tools"" or functions. this ability for llms to use tools is a very big deal -- but in most cases, we're using these tools to do back-end integrations, call apis and access data. but we can take tool use much further. we can give llms tools that allow human input. for example, if the llm needs to get a date from the user, it uses the tool to get that input, and we show an inline ui control for the user to enter a date. that control could allow natural language input next monday or a popup calendar. similarly, we could support all the ui primitives that are common text input, dropdown selection, etc. not the fanciest of uis, but even with the basic primitives, there's a lot we can do. and, i like how it keeps orchestration power in the hands of the llm and lets it worry about when human input might be required and a way to get it. over time, we could expand that model with more powerful ui controls grids, visualizers, image editors, etc. i can also conceive of a way to get human input asynchronously for longer-running tasks. for example we could have a ""senduserapprovallinkbyemail"". this would send the user an email with a link to approvecontinue the agentic workflow. there are likely much better ways to blend the ui, but this one has the value that it could actually be implemented by mere mortals like me, and it would be a step in the right direction.",-15,too_long,one thing that's been on my mind a lot lately: is a purely chat-based interface the optimal ui for humans to work with ai,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,33

dharmesh,"This article is based on a talk I gave at HubSpot's annual INBOUND event (in 2017, we had 21,000+ people!). Full video and slides of my talk are embedded below. Full Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0yqJa48ebs (I think you'll find it entertaining) I learned this from a late night dinner while glamping with Elon Musk many years ago ""Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors."" - Elon Musk I didn't fully understand this at first, so I had to go digging in my brain for what I could recall of linear algebra. Once I pieced together what he meant, the impact was profound. I later shared this lesson with my team at HubSpot. HubSpot is about 14 years old now and I've spoken at countless ""all-minds"" gatherings (our version of an ""all-hands""), written hundreds of articles and otherwise tried to share things I've learned with everyone. Of all the things I've shared, this ""aligning vectors"" idea is one of the lessons that has resonated the most. It ""stuck"". It has become part of our vocabulary and not a week goes by that I don't hear some reference to it in the halls of HubSpot. What's A Vector? In order to understand why aligning vectors is so important, we first need to understand (or remember) what a vector is. A vector is a quantity having both magnitude and direction . Every Person Is A Vector Now, let's say you have someone in your company that is a 9/10 on the competency/impact meter. They are clueful and committed. They're one of your best. Now, that impact score in and of itself does not make them a vector. Because the impact score is just a magnitude. It measures the strength/power/impact. But, there's no direction specified. We don't know which way this particular person is moving themselves or the company. It's what would be known as a scalar -- not a vector. Now, let's say we did know which direction this person was moving. Then, we'd have both magnitude and direction and they become a vector. This is commonly represented as an arrow. Now, imagine if there are four people in your company, and for simplicity, let's assume they all have an impact score (magnitude) of 9. These are what you might call your ""A players"" or ""Star Performers"". And, let's assume we know which direction each of them was moving in. What goals they're solving for. Which point they're trying to move to. Since we know their magnitude and direction, they're all vectors. This is what Elon meant when he said ""everyone in your company is a vector"". Sum Of All Vectors In linear algebra, it is possible to add two or more vectors together and get a resulting vector. The resulting vector is based on the magnitude of each vector being added and their direction . So, if we considered each person in the company as a vector, we could add them up, get a sum of all vectors and represent that sum with a single, new vector. That new vector is basically the direction and momentum your company is moving. Every person is a vector -- and them all up, and you know how much progress your company is going to make. Let's illustrate with a few simple examples using our four hypothetical team members. Scenario 1: The Null Vector Let's say that two of your people are pulling in one direction and the other two are pulling in the opposite direction. In this case, the sum of those four vectors is what's called a null vector . A null vector has zero magnitude and no direction. So, in our example, the company would be making zero progress. It's important to note that this is despite all four of the people being high-impact, competent people. In fact, they could all have been 10/10s (they're perfect!) and the result would still be zero. If you have perfect people and they're perfectly misaligned, the result is zero progress. Scenario #2: Sup-optimal Of course, that doesn't really happen in real-life where two or more people are moving in the opposite direction. That's just a hypothetical, right? This would never happen in our organizations, would it? Let's assume not. Let's look at a more realistic example. What's more common is that most people are pulling in the ""correct-ish"" direction, (except for that one person -- there always seems to be that one person). But, the sum of all vectors here is not zero, but it's also not the optimal possible vector. The resultant vector is not 36 units of impact pointed in the correct direction. This is better, but it's still not optimal. Scenario #3: Aligned Vectors (The Holy Grail of Alignment) The optimal answer is to have all the vectors aligned . That is, everyone is moving in the correct direction towards a unified goal. That's how you have maximum impact and how you make maximum progress . Add up all all the vectors and the magnitude of impact is actually 36. Nothing is being wasted, there's no inefficiency, there is no one pulling in the wrong direction, this is what we should be all striving for. This is what “ aligned vectors ” looks like. Now that we have an understanding of what ""aligning vectors"" means, let's dig in. Applying ""Aligning Vectors"" to Your Organization Although in the examples used, we're talking about aligning individual people with the organization's goals (so that everyone is pulling together in the right direction), that is just one of three broad areas. Here are the vectors that need to be aligned: Align people with the organization's goals. Aligning individual teams (product, marketing, sales, service, etc.) with the organization's goals. Aligning the organization's goals with the needs of the customer . The third one is one that a surprising number of organizations lose sight of. The people and teams are working together but they're solving for the wrong thing . They should be solving for the customer -- but instead, they're solving for internal tactical goals that lose sight of what the customer actually wants and needs. How Aligning Vectors Can Help Project Planning If you're like most organizations, you have a list of ""projects"" (or initiatives) somewhere. If you're good, you try to measure how well those projects are doing. What we started doing at HubSpot is looking at projects that are not going well and asking ourselves these two questions: Is the magnitude of investment in this project sufficient for what we want to accomplish? If not, we have a magnitude problem. We need more investment (more resources). Are the people and other related projects aligned with this one (and vice-versa)? If not, we have a directional, alignment problem. We need clearer direction, better communication and readjustment/realignment of vectors. Going through this exercise is often very revealing. Sometimes, it's shockingly obvious that we have a magnitude problem and other times it's obvious that we have an alignment problem. It's Vectors All The Way Down I've now become obsessed with vectors. It's vectors all the way down. Ever piece of content your marketing team produces is a vector. They should all be aligned. The partnerships you forge should be aligned vectors. It's just not just about magnitude (i.e. how big is the company you're partnering with), but how aligned is the partnership with both of your respective goals. If you're raising funding, don't just solve for deal terms (maximum valuation, minimum dilution, etc.) -- but figure out which investor is the best aligned with the kind of business you're trying to build. That will likely have a much larger impact on your outcome (and your happiness) than whoever offers the most money or highest valuation. How To Increase Progress Without Better People Or More Funding And, here's the thing that I found the most startling about this whole thing. It's profoundly simple. Assume you had to hold everything else constant -- no new people, no ""upgrades"" to the skills of existing people and no additional funding. Even then, you can still improve your rate of progress and level of success by better aligning your vectors . You can make more progress with the amazing people you already have simply by better aligning their vectors. We should pause and reflect on that for a moment -- because it means that all us have hope. We can be better. We can accomplish more. We can have more impact. We are not dependent on more money or smarter people. We can go further and have more impact by aligning vectors. The team that gets 80% of the decisions ""right"", but is 100% aligned will beat the team that gets 100% of the decisions right, but is only 80% aligned. So, what do you think?

this would never happen in our organizations, would it? let's assume not. let's look at a more realistic example. what's more common is that most people are pulling in the ""correct-ish"" direction, except for that one person -- there always seems to be that one person. but, the sum of all vectors here is not zero, but it's also not the optimal possible vector. the resultant vector is not 36 units of impact pointed in the correct direction. this is better, but it's still not optimal. scenario #3: aligned vectors the holy grail of alignment the optimal answer is to have all the vectors aligned . that is, everyone is moving in the correct direction towards a unified goal. that's how you have maximum impact and how you make maximum progress . add up all all the vectors and the magnitude of impact is actually 36. nothing is being wasted, there's no inefficiency, there is no one pulling in the wrong direction, this is what we should be all striving for. this is what  aligned vectors  looks like. now that we have an understanding of what ""aligning vectors"" means, let's dig in. applying ""aligning vectors"" to your organization although in the examples used, we're talking about aligning individual people with the organization's goals so that everyone is pulling together in the right direction, that is just one of three broad areas. here are the vectors that need to be aligned: align people with the organization's goals. aligning individual teams product, marketing, sales, service, etc. with the organization's goals. aligning the organization's goals with the needs of the customer . the third one is one that a surprising number of organizations lose sight of. the people and teams are working together but they're solving for the wrong thing . they should be solving for the customer -- but instead, they're solving for internal tactical goals that lose sight of what the customer actually wants and needs. how aligning vectors can help project planning if you're like most organizations, you have a list of ""projects"" or initiatives somewhere. if you're good, you try to measure how well those projects are doing. what we started doing at hubspot is looking at projects that are not going well and asking ourselves these two questions: is the magnitude of investment in this project sufficient for what we want to accomplish? if not, we have a magnitude problem. we need more investment more resources. are the people and other related projects aligned with this one and vice-versa? if not, we have a directional, alignment problem. we need clearer direction, better communication and readjustmentrealignment of vectors. going through this exercise is often very revealing. sometimes, it's shockingly obvious that we have a magnitude problem and other times it's obvious that we have an alignment problem. it's vectors all the way down i've now become obsessed with vectors. it's vectors all the way down. ever piece of content your marketing team produces is a vector. they should all be aligned. the partnerships you forge should be aligned vectors. it's just not just about magnitude i.e. how big is the company you're partnering with, but how aligned is the partnership with both of your respective goals. if you're raising funding, don't just solve for deal terms maximum valuation, minimum dilution, etc. -- but figure out which investor is the best aligned with the kind of business you're trying to build. that will likely have a much larger impact on your outcome and your happiness than whoever offers the most money or highest valuation. how to increase progress without better people or more funding and, here's the thing that i found the most startling about this whole thing. it's profoundly simple. assume you had to hold everything else constant -- no new people, no ""upgrades"" to the skills of existing people and no additional funding. even then, you can still improve your rate of progress and level of success by better aligning your vectors . you can make more progress with the amazing people you already have simply by better aligning their vectors. we should pause and reflect on that for a moment -- because it means that all us have hope. we can be better. we can accomplish more. we can have more impact. we are not dependent on more money or smarter people. we can go further and have more impact by aligning vectors. the team that gets 80 of the decisions ""right"", but is 100 aligned will beat the team that gets 100 of the decisions right, but is only 80 aligned. so, what do you think?

dharmesh,"Confession time : every company on Planet Startup claims they “love their customers.” Cute. But love, like that gym membership you bought in January, is only impressive if you actually use it. So how do you turn that warm, fuzzy feeling into a full‑blown, bonafide super‑power? Three progressively powerful levels await you. Ready? Cue the video‑game soundtrack. LEVEL 1: Good, Clean Living This is Customer Feedback 101—the spinach of business. • NPS surveys? Yes, please. • Follow-ups to customer support issues? Fantastic. • Bug hunts and feature wish lists? Like Pokémon, gotta catch ’em all. If you’re not doing any of this, stop reading, go do it, then come back. I'll wait … (Jeopardy theme plays softly.) LEVEL 2: Better, Cleaner Living Now we widen the lens from “product” to “experience.” Ask questions like: • Was pricing easy to find, or did it require a secret decoder ring? • Talking to Sales: pleasant chat or dental surgery without anesthesia? • Do your invoice emails read like a friendly note—or a ransom letter? • When customers change jobs, do they smuggle your software into the new gig like contraband coffee? If you’re gathering intel at this level, congrats—you’ve unlocked the “Customer Experience Nerd” badge. LEVEL 3 (Boss Level): It’s Not About You (Plot Twist!) Here’s where most companies wimp out. Collecting feedback is still you‑centered: “How can we polish our product? How can we fatten our revenue?” Important, sure, but not transcendent. Instead, zoom into the customer’s hopes, dreams, and 3 A.M. anxieties. Ask: • “Hey, how’s life treating you?” (Yes, seriously.) • “What monster problem keeps you caffeinated past midnight?” • “What would make you look like a rock star at your next all‑hands meeting?” Why bother? Because customers are people too (plot twist #2). And people who feel known become fans, not just fleeting users. That’s the difference between a handshake and a high‑five. “But Dharmesh,” you protest, “does this scale?” Nope. And that’s fine. Talk to 100 customers; extract one blinding insight; build something nobody else saw coming. That’s venture‑grade ROI right there. A close to home example: At HubSpot we don’t just build software; we try to build careers. (Software is lines of code. Careers are lines of destiny—way cooler.) So our questions aren’t limited to “Which button color converts best?” We also ask, “How do we help Sarah in Sales become Sarah the CEO someday?” That mindset has served us better than unlimited office snacks (which we also have)—and that’s saying something. The Takeaways (Because Every Article Post Needs Some) Success is about turning customer love into a super-power. Do the basics. Then do the better basics. Then do the human stuff that isn’t on anyone’s KPI dashboard (yet). Do that, and your relationship with customers will stop being a polite handshake and start looking a lot more like a superhero cape—billowing dramatically in the updraft of shared success. And if you're really looking to be supercool, start learning about AI agents and see how they can help create better customer connection. I (of course) recommend starting with agent.ai .

avr27,"In my previous post , I shared a higher level understanding of NMT(Neural Machine Translation) architecture. So, continuing from there: With the same context of language translation, let's see how different aspects of it work together. On a higher level, we have 4 major components: Embedding Layer - vector(numerical) representation of text data Encoder - that which understands the source language and condenses the patterns learned into what we call context/thought vector. Context Vector - the summarized representation of source language produced by the encoder Decoder - which is responsible for decoding the context vector into the desired translation. Let's connect the dots b/w the embedding layer, the encoder, the context vector, and the decoder: We use two-word embedding layers, one for the source language and the other for the target, to better represent the semantics b/w the words of the respective languages. The encoder is responsible for generating a thought vector or a context vector representing what the source language means. The encoder is an RNN cell. At time step t_0, the encoder is initialized with a zero vector by default. After finally getting trained on the sequence of source sentences/words, It produces a context vector, which is it's final external hidden state. The context vector's idea is to concisely represent a source language sentence. Also, in contrast to how the encoder’s state is initialized (i.e., it is initialized with zeros), the context vector becomes the initial state for the decoder. This links the encoder and the decoder, making the whole model end-to-end differentiable. The decoder is responsible for decoding the context vector into the desired translation. Our decoder is an RNN as well. The context vector is the only piece of information that is available to the decoder about the source sentence. Thus, it is a crucial link b/w encoder and decoder. After getting initialized with the context vector as its initial state, the decoder then learns the patterns in the target text. Though it is possible for the encoder and decoder to share the same set of weights, it is usually better to use two different networks for the encoder and the decoder. This increases the number of parameters in our model, allowing us to learn the translations more effectively. For the prediction, we use something like the softmax function to predict the words. The full NMT system, with the details of how the GRU cell in the encoder connects to the GRU cell in the decoder and how the softmax layer is used to output predictions, is shown: We can also add Attention Mechanism to our decoder, which I briefly discussed in my previous post . In brief, adding attention to the decoder implies that it allows the decoder access to the encoder's state in order to learn more about the source sentence. In my next post, I'll discuss in more detail about ""Attention Mechanism"" and why the context vector is not sufficient to produce good quality translations. BTW, if you are interested in learning more about this, here is my very in-depth notebook on this topic, explaining the concepts and code implementation in great detail. 🔗GitHub Link: Seq2Seq Learning - Implementing NMT System",15.0,0.0,891,,7703,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],1,1,['🔗'],0,[],3226,3212,528,528,27,0,0,0,"in my previous post , i shared a higher level understanding of nmtneural machine translation architecture. so, continuing from there: with the same context of language translation, let's see how different aspects of it work together. on a higher level, we have 4 major components: embedding layer - vectornumerical representation of text data encoder - that which understands the source language and condenses the patterns learned into what we call contextthought vector. context vector - the summarized representation of source language produced by the encoder decoder - which is responsible for decoding the context vector into the desired translation. let's connect the dots bw the embedding layer, the encoder, the context vector, and the decoder: we use two-word embedding layers, one for the source language and the other for the target, to better represent the semantics bw the words of the respective languages. the encoder is responsible for generating a thought vector or a context vector representing what the source language means. the encoder is an rnn cell. at time step t0, the encoder is initialized with a zero vector by default. after finally getting trained on the sequence of source sentenceswords, it produces a context vector, which is it's final external hidden state. the context vector's idea is to concisely represent a source language sentence. also, in contrast to how the encoders state is initialized i.e., it is initialized with zeros, the context vector becomes the initial state for the decoder. this links the encoder and the decoder, making the whole model end-to-end differentiable. the decoder is responsible for decoding the context vector into the desired translation. our decoder is an rnn as well. the context vector is the only piece of information that is available to the decoder about the source sentence. thus, it is a crucial link bw encoder and decoder. after getting initialized with the context vector as its initial state, the decoder then learns the patterns in the target text. though it is possible for the encoder and decoder to share the same set of weights, it is usually better to use two different networks for the encoder and the decoder. this increases the number of parameters in our model, allowing us to learn the translations more effectively. for the prediction, we use something like the softmax function to predict the words. the full nmt system, with the details of how the gru cell in the encoder connects to the gru cell in the decoder and how the softmax layer is used to output predictions, is shown: we can also add attention mechanism to our decoder, which i briefly discussed in my previous post . in brief, adding attention to the decoder implies that it allows the decoder access to the encoder's state in order to learn more about the source sentence. in my next post, i'll discuss in more detail about ""attention mechanism"" and why the context vector is not sufficient to produce good quality translations. btw, if you are interested in learning more about this, here is my very in-depth notebook on this topic, explaining the concepts and code implementation in great detail. github link: seq2seq learning - implementing nmt system",-15,too_long,"in my previous post , i shared a higher level understanding of nmtneural machine translation architecture",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,33,33

Being productive, though, is about delivering value and is much harder: to be productive you have to make sure all the work you're doing is valuable , and minimise waste and unnecessary work.

You must go further than simply plucking tickets from a queue and doing what they say. Remember, you're not building software for the sake of it; you're building a product and a business. Know your product and you'll make better decisions while you're building it. Design your software. Software development is not primarily about coding; it's about designing software systems. Coding is the bit that happens once you have come up with a high-quality design. If you don't take the time to make plans and get input from your colleagues, you will make errors that introduce bugs and technical debt. Having discussions and writing documentation to capture your plans is not a waste of time. It's a key part of your job of a software engineer. It may not feel like it, but this will save you time in the long run. Question everything. Ask ""why?"" a lot. It's amazing what you'll learn, and the ways in which this will help you do things right the first time. Rigorous scrutiny and debate is a hallmark of a top engineering culture. Always be respectful, but never hesitate to subject things to scrutiny. Be lazy. The best way to do a piece of work efficiently is to avoid doing it at all! Is there an existing tool or feature that you can use? Can you reframe the problem so that a much less costly solution does the job? Is this whole thing even worth doing at all? Always ask the questions.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"2024 Look Back LinkedIn Article Looking back at 2024, it’s been an incredible year filled with many global events that captured attention. We saw the rise of ChatGPT, which continues to help many people discover their hidden potential, countries coming together to triple climate finance for developing nations to better support their efforts, and on a fun note, the debut of breakdancing at the Summer Olympics that took the world by storm. For me, three themes stood out for business: digital transformation, evolving cyber threats and growing sustainably. Transforming the way we work, live and interact Singtel has come a long way since achieving nationwide 5G coverage in July 2022. We’ve been unlocking many new features such as network slicing so enterprises can exploit the technology to build new apps, operate more efficiently and enhance their customer engagement experiences. It’s exciting to see how network slicing and other 5G capabilities are being used across sectors like healthcare for surgical planning using augmented and mixed reality applications, advanced manufacturing to assemble cars or check for defects in products, and so much more. 3D visualisation of organs via mixed- and augmented-reality applications That’s not all. By tapping on the huge volumes of data we process through our networks, we’re able to develop Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that can be used to tailor solutions that meet the unique needs of businesses. For instance, we can use APIs to build security apps that detect and mitigate threats in real time, enable seamless integration of payment systems, or even test and deploy multilingual communication platforms. This makes it easier for enterprises and developers to have the tools to create truly personalised and powerful digital experiences. And for greater impact, we’ve been forging global alliances to explore APIs in a range of areas like security, 5G, and customer service. We’re developing a global first multilingual telco-specific large language model (LLM) with other leading telcos Deutsche Telekom, e&, and SK Telecom, as well as SoftBank that can be applied worldwide, democratising AI in the region. These advancements are not just transforming industries but impacting everyday lives. Tackling Cyber Threats Another game-changer is AI which has brought new opportunities for business innovation and growth as well as challenges like evolving scams and cybersecurity risks. This year, we rolled out many AI-enabled measures to enhance our scam prevention capabilities. One proud achievement is the development of SingVerify that leverages telco data to perform authentication in real time. It’s all done in the background and more importantly, provides an additional layer of defence from scams and fraud. But for this to be truly effective, we need to include all the local telcos and we’re working on that. In tandem, we’ve taken this initiative regional by deploying it in Malaysia and Thailand. Through our efforts, we’re protecting over 57 million customers in these markets. By federating the telco APIs more telcos can protect their customers from digital fraud and scams. Here is us signing an MoU with M1 to extend the protection to their customers. As much as we’re grappling with beating the ever-evolving cyber threat – a new form is in the works that’ll be more powerful than any other threat we’ve faced before. Quantum computing will soon become mainstream and will render current encryption and security measures ineffective. There is a pressing need to protect businesses here and our way of life. To get ahead of the threats, we launched Southeast Asia’s first quantum-safe network with industry leaders and have been progressively building a robust ecosystem of solutions that will help enterprises safeguard their digital assets. It’s all about staying one step ahead because the bad guys are also preparing, and we can’t wait for them to show their hands and react – we’ll likely to be too late. Having the technology alone isn’t enough. We need to prepare our workforce to have the skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital and automated world. That’s why we’ve been investing in equipping our employees in areas like AI, cybersecurity and 5G so they can harness the tech as transformative tools and not fear that their jobs will be taken over. All companies should be actively looking into this to ensure their staff and businesses are ready for what’s to come. Making Sustainability Real As we continue to pursue new innovations, we are mindful of our impact on our planet. For years, we’ve taken steps to lower our carbon emissions throughout the supply chain – from switching to electric vehicles, tapping solar energy for business operations, and cutting down on plastic packaging, to name a few. Our upcoming data centres are also going to use highly-efficient cooling technologies to cut water consumption. We will continue to explore the latest technology and industry best practices to reduce our carbon footprint as we work towards our net-zero 2045 goal. One of the exciting projects I was involved in this year, was the opening of Sisters’ Islands Marine Park, which includes a lagoon tidal pool that has underwater cameras powered by #Singtel5G. With our connectivity, we’re bringing a slice of Singapore’s incredible biodiversity into classrooms, to help students see the natural world in a whole new way and hopefully appreciate and learn to care more about our environment. The tidal pool will serve as a sanctuary for marine life and a living classroom for future generations to learn about and appreciate our thriving bio-diverse ecosystem. It's also been a year of milestones for Singtel Singapore. We scored a couple of big wins globally like with Nestlé, one of the world’s biggest food manufacturers. We’re helping to turn their global network into a cloud-centric one. On our shores, we’re helping PSA to build a fully sustainable and autonomous port to meet rising global transshipment demand. These are proud moments for me when you can see the impact of what we do. At the Tuas Port, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) will be upgraded to enhance real-time shipment tracking and further streamline crane operations. As we step into 2025, we’ll be looking into how we can further harness emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing, and 6G to address the most pressing challenges of our time. Sustainability will remain a core focus as we explore innovative ways to reduce our carbon footprint while driving digital transformation. Technology for me has the power to bring us closer, to solve big problems, and to unlock new opportunities. And I know as a community we can achieve so much together. So let’s keep pushing the boundaries for a better future.

Hopefully this reduces both GenAI agent costs and website request hammering from agents as they accomplish their task with fewer requests to the web server by nature of getting it right the first time via the WebMCP tool. The Declarative API (described in the Google documentation linked below) to enable web developers to set up WebMCP for their site seems to be really simple, especially if the functionality you want to provide to the GenAI agent can already be performed by the user through an HTML form element.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"Tomorrow marks an eventful first year for me at Singtel. I continue to be amazed by my immensely talented colleagues who live our purpose of empowering every generation in every product and service they deliver. I’ve had a busy year restructuring the business to get us fitter. From setting up a new leadership team and integrating the consumer and enterprise streams to simplifying our product portfolio and improving customer experiences – it’s been a sea of change but am glad to have a great team to do this with. Some notable moments include: 1. Getting future-ready. Evolving cyberthreats, including mobile phone scams, are an area of concern with victims in Singapore having lost more than half a billion dollars in 2023. Added to this is the emergence of deepfake videos spreading disinformation which can lead to harm. As the telco with the largest customer base in Singapore, we take this very seriously because we know that our customers rely on our expertise to keep them safe. Last September, we introduced Cyber Elevate, a one-stop affordable cyber security resilience programme designed to equip #SMEs with the necessary capabilities and skillsets to prepare, detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks. We also teamed up with the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM) Academy to develop “Defence Against Cyber Scams"" – a cyber scam preparedness programme aimed at #upskilling and #reskilling staff large enterprises, especially those handling frontline communications from financial institutions that are more commonly targeted by scammers. The programme kicked off with UOB - training over 1,000 of their frontline branch staff. These are meant to prepare small businesses and employees deal with increasingly sophisticated threats, many which involve social engineering. We’re also very proud that Singtel has been appointed by IMDA to develop Singapore’s first National Quantum-Safe Network Plus (#NQSN+) for enterprises, in partnership with global industry leaders, ID Quantique, Fortinet, Cisco and Nokia to secure Singapore against future threats. To many, the idea of getting scammed or cyber attacked is seen as a distance threat or something that’ll “never happen to us”. “We’re just an SME, nobody will want to attack us,” is another common refrain. But the nature of the fast-evolving technology is that the measures of today will fast become obsolete. And to wait till things are dire to set things up is like trying to put out a forest fire when it’s at your doorstop – it might be too late. Not to sound too dramatic but seeing how quickly businesses, especially SMEs, can crumble when faced with such calamities, we cannot emphasise enough, the importance of being prepared. And we know it can seem overwhelming to the small businesses – but there are numerous avenues to seek help, including government grants to offset costs. Inaction in this matter, could be fatal. 2. Going more social. The convergence of social connections and commerce is driving more personalised, social and interactive purchasing experiences for customers, and this will increase in the years to come. That’s why we added a Tik Tok studio to our flagship store, 313@Somerset, so we can help content creators and entrepreneurs build their brands or sell their products using the popular social platform. We also added dedicated spaces within our store for our partner brands to engage and educate customers on their products and services; to this end, the first Casetify studio in Singapore that has done so well. For larger brands, providing that personal touch can be challenging amidst rising manpower shortages. Like many organisations, Singtel’s been leveraging AI to automate more routine tasks such as making payments and replacing SIM cards, so that our customer service agents can be freed up to support customers in more meaningful and personal ways. But we want to be able to offer our customers more. Considering the high volume of data that telcos possess, we wanted to find a way to leverage this data to provide more value-added services to our customers. So we teamed up with leading telcos, SKT, TMobile and e&, with the support of Softbank, to develop Large Language Models (#LLM), optimised for the telecommunications industry. Covering languages such as Korean, English, German, Japanese and Bahasa, the LLMs are helping us to improve our customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots. Soon, interactions across countries will no longer be limited by language barriers. Companies that’d like to scale beyond Singapore should factor in such advancements into their future plans. 3. Bridging divides and connecting communities. I had my first chance to participate in many of our ESG activities – from planting trees to meeting many of our wonderful special needs students with all their hidden talents. It was a humbling experience for me to experience their tenacity and positive attitude. They truly teach us the value of empathy and how to harness our strengths. Our seniors are another resilient group teaching us how to be adaptable. Though many understand how to use the basics, there are many who are not as tech savvy and need help navigating their way through an increasingly digital world. Between the hustle and bustle of our day-to-day, let’s find ways to support these vulnerable groups so they too can feel connected in a digital economy. Change can be good. Many technology innovations have emerged over the past year, rapidly shifting how we live, work and play. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the form of Generative AI tools like #ChatGPT, quantum computing, #metaverse, #blockchain, augmented and virtual reality (#AR&VR), and other technology breakthroughs are shaping a new world. I am looking forward to an even more exciting year ahead and very proud to be working in a place that’s always striving to be at the leading edge of innovation to uplift communities and advance economies. #CyberSecurityInstitute #SingtelCSI #DigitalConnectivityBlueprint #SmartNation #Singtel5G #SingtelAI",976.0,66.0,628,,30044,article,0,0,0,[],1,['@Somerset'],0,0,[],15,"['#SMEs', '#upskilling', '#reskilling', '#NQSN', '#LLM', '#ChatGPT', '#metaverse', '#blockchain', '#AR', '#CyberSecurityInstitute', '#SingtelCSI', '#DigitalConnectivityBlueprint', '#SmartNation', '#Singtel5G', '#SingtelAI']",6050,6013,960,955,47,0,0,0,"tomorrow marks an eventful first year for me at singtel. i continue to be amazed by my immensely talented colleagues who live our purpose of empowering every generation in every product and service they deliver. ive had a busy year restructuring the business to get us fitter. from setting up a new leadership team and integrating the consumer and enterprise streams to simplifying our product portfolio and improving customer experiences  its been a sea of change but am glad to have a great team to do this with. some notable moments include: 1. getting future-ready. evolving cyberthreats, including mobile phone scams, are an area of concern with victims in singapore having lost more than half a billion dollars in 2023. added to this is the emergence of deepfake videos spreading disinformation which can lead to harm. as the telco with the largest customer base in singapore, we take this very seriously because we know that our customers rely on our expertise to keep them safe. last september, we introduced cyber elevate, a one-stop affordable cyber security resilience programme designed to equip #smes with the necessary capabilities and skillsets to prepare, detect, respond and recover from cyber-attacks. we also teamed up with the singapore institute of management sim academy to develop defence against cyber scams""  a cyber scam preparedness programme aimed at #upskilling and #reskilling staff large enterprises, especially those handling frontline communications from financial institutions that are more commonly targeted by scammers. the programme kicked off with uob - training over 1,000 of their frontline branch staff. these are meant to prepare small businesses and employees deal with increasingly sophisticated threats, many which involve social engineering. were also very proud that singtel has been appointed by imda to develop singapores first national quantum-safe network plus #nqsn for enterprises, in partnership with global industry leaders, id quantique, fortinet, cisco and nokia to secure singapore against future threats. to many, the idea of getting scammed or cyber attacked is seen as a distance threat or something thatll never happen to us. were just an sme, nobody will want to attack us, is another common refrain. but the nature of the fast-evolving technology is that the measures of today will fast become obsolete. and to wait till things are dire to set things up is like trying to put out a forest fire when its at your doorstop  it might be too late. not to sound too dramatic but seeing how quickly businesses, especially smes, can crumble when faced with such calamities, we cannot emphasise enough, the importance of being prepared. and we know it can seem overwhelming to the small businesses  but there are numerous avenues to seek help, including government grants to offset costs. inaction in this matter, could be fatal. 2. going more social. the convergence of social connections and commerce is driving more personalised, social and interactive purchasing experiences for customers, and this will increase in the years to come. thats why we added a tik tok studio to our flagship store, 313mention, so we can help content creators and entrepreneurs build their brands or sell their products using the popular social platform. we also added dedicated spaces within our store for our partner brands to engage and educate customers on their products and services; to this end, the first casetify studio in singapore that has done so well. for larger brands, providing that personal touch can be challenging amidst rising manpower shortages. like many organisations, singtels been leveraging ai to automate more routine tasks such as making payments and replacing sim cards, so that our customer service agents can be freed up to support customers in more meaningful and personal ways. but we want to be able to offer our customers more. considering the high volume of data that telcos possess, we wanted to find a way to leverage this data to provide more value-added services to our customers. so we teamed up with leading telcos, skt, tmobile and e, with the support of softbank, to develop large language models #llm, optimised for the telecommunications industry. covering languages such as korean, english, german, japanese and bahasa, the llms are helping us to improve our customer interactions via digital assistants and chatbots. soon, interactions across countries will no longer be limited by language barriers. companies thatd like to scale beyond singapore should factor in such advancements into their future plans. 3. bridging divides and connecting communities. i had my first chance to participate in many of our esg activities  from planting trees to meeting many of our wonderful special needs students with all their hidden talents. it was a humbling experience for me to experience their tenacity and positive attitude. they truly teach us the value of empathy and how to harness our strengths. our seniors are another resilient group teaching us how to be adaptable. though many understand how to use the basics, there are many who are not as tech savvy and need help navigating their way through an increasingly digital world. between the hustle and bustle of our day-to-day, lets find ways to support these vulnerable groups so they too can feel connected in a digital economy. change can be good. many technology innovations have emerged over the past year, rapidly shifting how we live, work and play. artificial intelligence ai in the form of generative ai tools like #chatgpt, quantum computing, #metaverse, #blockchain, augmented and virtual reality #arvr, and other technology breakthroughs are shaping a new world. i am looking forward to an even more exciting year ahead and very proud to be working in a place thats always striving to be at the leading edge of innovation to uplift communities and advance economies. #cybersecurityinstitute #singtelcsi #digitalconnectivityblueprint #smartnation #singtel5g #singtelai",-15,too_long,tomorrow marks an eventful first year for me at singtel,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,4,21,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,5,product_focused,-8,1,0,0,0,0,0,55,55

No one called this a startup. But it was entrepreneurship in its most durable form. Long before the word startup entered everyday vocabulary, India had a deep and functioning business culture. It lived inside trading communities, family enterprises, and apprenticeship-led industries like jewellery, diamonds, textiles, and manufacturing.

In the 90s and early 2000s, as India liberalised, attention shifted. Multinationals became aspirational, MBAs became credentials, and large organisations became the safest way to grow with status and structure. Business ownership didn’t disappear, but it moved out of the spotlight. For an entire generation, success became less about building something of your own and more about being selected by institutions that promised growth with guardrails. What has changed in the last decade is not the instinct to build, but ACCESS. Startup culture has quietly democratised capital and legitimacy. Capital no longer flows only through family networks or traditional business communities; it increasingly flows through ideas, execution, and market opportunity. Just as importantly, legitimacy — the permission to try — is no longer tied to lineage, geography, or a specific set of industries. This is why startups feel culturally significant.

alexchriss,"Andy Kessler argued last year that fluency in coding is now more important than fluency in traditional human languages. While it’s an extreme opinion, he’s hardly alone in this sentiment. The proliferation of advanced technology like artificial intelligence and its highly publicized potential to change the workforce has fueled an intense focus on STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education across the United States. Schools around the country are adjusting their curriculum accordingly, with the goal of giving today’s students the technical skills they need to “survive” in this new robot-driven workplace. Silicon Valley in particular has perpetuated the idea that a tech education is paramount to career success. Apple’s Tim Cook urged the President that “coding should be a requirement in every public school.” Google and Facebook now offer crash courses and internships for employees in emerging technologies. Meanwhile, data and analytics-focused education startups like MissionU are attempting to take the place of a traditional university education, promising students to better prepare them “to succeed in the 21st century workforce.” In this climate, a good old fashioned Liberal Arts degree seems like the last thing anyone should pursue. While it’s true that STEM skills provide practical tools for the future workforce, this doesn’t mean the so-called “soft” studies are diminishing in value. In fact, counter-intuitive as it may seem, the uniquely human skills polished by a well-rounded Liberal Arts education will make job candidates more competitive for all roles in the digital economy – whether you’re an artist, or an engineer. Differentiation over Preparation The “STEM only” mindset is misguided because it focuses narrowly on job preparation . It assumes that the rise in advanced technology in the workplace means most career opportunities will be those requiring highly technical skills, and students should therefore focus their studies vocationally. But job preparation is a small part of the equation. When it comes to securing a future career, what’s perhaps more important is that students focus their studies on those skills that will most differentiate them from technology. After all, though it’s optimistic to think otherwise, technology can’t do everything. Consider creativity, critical thinking, adaptability, and empathy, to name just a few of the traits we humans possess. As technology and automation tools handle an increasing number of tasks in the workplace, these uniquely human qualities will be especially crucial for today’s graduates because the jobs that remain will be those that can’t easily be performed by a robot or a computer. Take a look at McKinsey’s report on automation . Each of the jobs noted as comparably unsusceptible to automation all have one thing in common: soft skills. These are jobs that involve “ managing and developing people (9 percent automation potential), where expertise is applied to decision-making, planning, or creative work (18 percent), or interacting with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders (20 percent).” According to this report, the workplace gaps that will be left in the wake of technology are not those requiring a deep technical expertise, but those that rely on a mastery of the soft skills – the very skills cultivated by a broad Liberal Arts education. “Seeking Humanities Grads” Counter to the popular narrative in Silicon Valley, it turns out soft-skills jobs have been steadily growing since the 1980s. A Harvard Graduate School of Education paper found that nearly all job growth over the past 30 years has been in occupations that are relatively “social skill-intensive.” Moreover, recruiters today are prioritizing soft skills in job candidates, even for the most technical of roles. CareerBuilder’s 2017 job forecast found that 62 percent of employers rated soft skills as very important when hiring (a sentiment echoed by this Wall Street Journal survey ). Just a few years ago, LinkedIn found that the third most popular role for Liberal Arts grads was within software development. Take it from this startup CEO , who claims that a humanities foundation and “the uniquely human ability to draw upon experience” has been invaluable for his team of software, UI, and UX designers. From a macro perspective, we’ll see more career opportunities related to the arts and soft studies develop over the coming decade, with the emergence of a new artisan economy . Strong consumer appetite for all things niche, combined with lower barriers to start and operate a business (thanks to technology and the Internet), will contribute to a reemergence of merchant-craftspeople producing specialty goods. And unlike the artisans of the Middle Ages, today’s artisans can reach a massive pool of customers. In this new economy, artists and creatives have opportunities to make viable, sustainable careers for themselves and their families – something that may not have been achievable even a decade ago. My Plea to Students There can be no doubt that in a world that’s increasingly digital, an understanding of computer science is practical for new entrants to the workforce. But that doesn’t mean that we should disregard the very languages – the human languages – that make us unique contributors. In fact, the most effective workplaces are those that combine technical and human elements (the best engineers I’ve worked with are those who approach product development through a creative marketing lens). For students with interests in Liberal Arts, here is my plea: Don’t drop your creative ambitions. If you really want to stand out in the job market, now is the time to cultivate them. A Liberal Arts education will teach you to think critically and creatively, to collaborate with and manage people, and to demonstrate human empathy and compassion. As a consequence, I expect you’ll find more interest from potential employers, not less. Let’s shift the dialogue from “how can today’s students prepare for the jobs of tomorrow?” to “how can today’s students differentiate themselves and provide the most value in the new world of work?” My quick answer: Don’t ditch that Liberal Arts degree. Originally posted to U.S. News & World Report on January 19, 2018.",196.0,20.0,2942,,89867,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],6280,6213,989,982,46,2,0,0,"andy kessler argued last year that fluency in coding is now more important than fluency in traditional human languages. while its an extreme opinion, hes hardly alone in this sentiment. the proliferation of advanced technology like artificial intelligence and its highly publicized potential to change the workforce has fueled an intense focus on stem science, technology, engineering and math education across the united states. schools around the country are adjusting their curriculum accordingly, with the goal of giving todays students the technical skills they need to survive in this new robot-driven workplace. silicon valley in particular has perpetuated the idea that a tech education is paramount to career success. apples tim cook urged the president that coding should be a requirement in every public school. google and facebook now offer crash courses and internships for employees in emerging technologies. meanwhile, data and analytics-focused education startups like missionu are attempting to take the place of a traditional university education, promising students to better prepare them to succeed in the 21st century workforce. in this climate, a good old fashioned liberal arts degree seems like the last thing anyone should pursue. while its true that stem skills provide practical tools for the future workforce, this doesnt mean the so-called soft studies are diminishing in value. in fact, counter-intuitive as it may seem, the uniquely human skills polished by a well-rounded liberal arts education will make job candidates more competitive for all roles in the digital economy  whether youre an artist, or an engineer. differentiation over preparation the stem only mindset is misguided because it focuses narrowly on job preparation . it assumes that the rise in advanced technology in the workplace means most career opportunities will be those requiring highly technical skills, and students should therefore focus their studies vocationally. but job preparation is a small part of the equation. when it comes to securing a future career, whats perhaps more important is that students focus their studies on those skills that will most differentiate them from technology. after all, though its optimistic to think otherwise, technology cant do everything. consider creativity, critical thinking, adaptability, and empathy, to name just a few of the traits we humans possess. as technology and automation tools handle an increasing number of tasks in the workplace, these uniquely human qualities will be especially crucial for todays graduates because the jobs that remain will be those that cant easily be performed by a robot or a computer. take a look at mckinseys report on automation . each of the jobs noted as comparably unsusceptible to automation all have one thing in common: soft skills. these are jobs that involve  managing and developing people 9 percent automation potential, where expertise is applied to decision-making, planning, or creative work 18 percent, or interacting with customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders 20 percent. according to this report, the workplace gaps that will be left in the wake of technology are not those requiring a deep technical expertise, but those that rely on a mastery of the soft skills  the very skills cultivated by a broad liberal arts education. seeking humanities grads counter to the popular narrative in silicon valley, it turns out soft-skills jobs have been steadily growing since the 1980s. a harvard graduate school of education paper found that nearly all job growth over the past 30 years has been in occupations that are relatively social skill-intensive. moreover, recruiters today are prioritizing soft skills in job candidates, even for the most technical of roles. careerbuilders 2017 job forecast found that 62 percent of employers rated soft skills as very important when hiring a sentiment echoed by this wall street journal survey . just a few years ago, linkedin found that the third most popular role for liberal arts grads was within software development. take it from this startup ceo , who claims that a humanities foundation and the uniquely human ability to draw upon experience has been invaluable for his team of software, ui, and ux designers. from a macro perspective, well see more career opportunities related to the arts and soft studies develop over the coming decade, with the emergence of a new artisan economy . strong consumer appetite for all things niche, combined with lower barriers to start and operate a business thanks to technology and the internet, will contribute to a reemergence of merchant-craftspeople producing specialty goods. and unlike the artisans of the middle ages, todays artisans can reach a massive pool of customers. in this new economy, artists and creatives have opportunities to make viable, sustainable careers for themselves and their families  something that may not have been achievable even a decade ago. my plea to students there can be no doubt that in a world thats increasingly digital, an understanding of computer science is practical for new entrants to the workforce. but that doesnt mean that we should disregard the very languages  the human languages  that make us unique contributors. in fact, the most effective workplaces are those that combine technical and human elements the best engineers ive worked with are those who approach product development through a creative marketing lens. for students with interests in liberal arts, here is my plea: dont drop your creative ambitions. if you really want to stand out in the job market, now is the time to cultivate them. a liberal arts education will teach you to think critically and creatively, to collaborate with and manage people, and to demonstrate human empathy and compassion. as a consequence, i expect youll find more interest from potential employers, not less. lets shift the dialogue from how can todays students prepare for the jobs of tomorrow? to how can todays students differentiate themselves and provide the most value in the new world of work? my quick answer: dont ditch that liberal arts degree. originally posted to u.s. news  world

alexchriss,"Now more than ever, small business workforces are fluid, with owners increasingly turning to freelancers, contractors, and other specialized, on-demand talent who can support projects as needed. A study by LinkedIn found that small businesses are responsible for an estimated 40 percent of all hires across the on-demand economy (for which a projected 9.2 million people will be working by 2021). Additionally, 42 percent of employer firms use contract workers, according to a small business survey by the Federal Reserve. Fluid work arrangements are becoming more commonplace in the small business community because they offer owners a flexible, low-cost way to scale their workforce. Workers are paid by the project, as managers adjust staffing based on customer demand. A huge number of online platforms, including services like Upwork, Wonolo, and niche sites like Field Nation and UpCounsel, have also made it easier to hire and manage on-demand talent. But more business flexibility and agility comes with a catch: Fluid workers -- most of whom work remotely and intermittently -- present new challenges from their nine-to-five counterparts. In this new world of work, a more tailored managerial approach is required. Here are three tips from real small businesses that have figured it out: 1. Ask a lot of questions to build rapport. Tippy Tippens is the founder of Goods That Matter , a New Orleans-based company that sells U.S.-made, eco-friendly goods, and relies on independent creators to make products during busy seasons. Tippens says that hiring contractors over employees brings more freedom to her day, giving her more time to devote to strategic and creative decisions instead of day-to-day staff management. Tippens's advice: Build a solid rapport initially so that both sides enjoy the partnership. When discussing project terms, ask a lot of questions to help you get a sense for the contractor's personality and work style. In a new project, there are always issues that arise. If you enjoy the person you’re working with, it will allow you to handle the inevitable hiccups more easily. Nourishing strong, mutually beneficial relationships from the start should be every small business owner’s goal, as it will help you to avoid miscommunication, tackle issues collaboratively and maintain a positive partnership. 2. Be explicit about project expectations. Martina Brimmer is co-founder of Swift Industries , a bicycle bag company based in Seattle. Her team of contractors support the business with special projects, from sewing bags, to bookkeeping and more. As they navigate the hurdles of growing the business, hiring independent experts allows Brimmer to leverage top talent for areas like photography or design, where they can't justify a full-time position. Brimmer's advice: In the very first conversation, make sure your project expectations and deadlines are clearly laid out. Most contractors don’t work on-site under the supervision of the small business owner, so it’s important to be completely transparent about project expectations from the beginning. Getting on the same page in terms of deliverables will help you build trust in the freelancer to fulfill his or her commitment, while removing ambiguity on their end and setting them up for success in the project. 3. Leverage online tools for always-on coordination. Nexus Academics is an educational consultancy in New York that focuses on college and standardized test preparation. Founder Jacob Feldman relies on a network of freelancers across the region to develop academic materials and coach students. This arrangement is ideal for the heavily seasonal academic industry, as demand peaks in advance of standardized tests and college application deadlines. Feldman's advice: Use online tools like Google's G Suite to stay in lock step with remote workers. Feldman uses Google Calendar to track tutors' hours, and its integration with QuickBooks Online for easy client invoicing. He also keeps the entire library of course material in Google Docs, and via Google Hangouts, he regularly syncs with tutors to work through materials and conduct meetings. As Nexus Academics demonstrates, a distributed workforce doesn’t mean that you need to compromise close collaboration and communication. Fortunately, today there is a plethora of online tools available that remove the limitations of physical barriers and help guarantee that all workers feel connected and informed. It's an exciting time for small business owners and self-employed individuals alike, as fluid work arrangements are making businesses more nimble and competitive while giving independent workers more control over their schedules. As non-traditional, fluid workforces become even more prevalent, the best practices on how to hire, train, manage, and mentor these workers will continue to evolve. For now, use this advice as a starting point and remember: Managing independent workers takes a nuanced, delicate hand.

suniel-shetty,"Fact is, a majority of us Indians, whether entrepreneurs, founders or professionals, think very differently about risk compared to how it is discussed or celebrated. It’s not that we are afraid of it. We just don’t romanticise it. On social media, risk often sounds glamorous. Go all in. Take the leap. Do it now or stay stuck. But on the ground, we know life looks very different. For many of us, there is a lot riding on our choices. Parents back home who’ve put their life’s savings into education. Families that depend on a monthly income. Loans. EMIs. Responsibilities that don’t pause while you figure things out. When you come from a simple background, risk is not theoretical. It’s personal. So decisions tend to be measured. Thought through. Taken with a clear understanding of what can be stretched, and what cannot be lost. I’ve seen people work incredibly hard, take smart chances, and still choose not to take big risks with their careers. Not because they lack ambition. But because failure doesn’t affect only them. This applies just as much to a professional deciding whether to quit a stable and safe job, as it does to a founder deciding how fast to scale. All or nothing sounds exciting in interviews of people who made it. In real life, it can cost far more than it appears. Your appetite for risk is tied to your circumstances. What I respect about this mindset is the strength it builds. When you build with responsibility, you are forced to think long term. You pace yourself. You learn to survive slow months, bad phases and unexpected turns. That doesn’t make you cautious. It makes you prepared. I relate to this personally. In my early years in films, I played it safe with the kind of roles I chose. Action films mainly. Familiar territory. I needed to secure my place, stay relevant and keep getting work. Only later, when it was safer did I start taking risks with different roles and genres. Films that were a little hatke for their time. Hu Tu Tu with Gulzar saab. Comedies like Hera Pheri. I was convinced these risks would pay off, but the fact was I just couldn’t afford to take them earlier. If you’re in a phase where you can’t take big leaps, it doesn’t mean your options are limited. It just means your path will unfold differently. Everyone’s journey is unique. There is no single correct timeline. The goal is not to win fast. It’s to stay in the game long enough to win well.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"In 1989 I made two momentous decisions. I chose to marry Patricia, my partner for life, and I chose to start my career at HP. 33 years later and I regret neither of those choices. Not for one instant. 33 years. In that time, I have grown immensely, as a husband, as a father, as a young graduate starting out on his career, in my duty to Singapore, and as a leader at HP and in the industry, as part of a huge, extended family. And it’s always been about the people, through the highlights and the lowlights, through the challenges and the long nights, it’s about the people you learn from, lean on, laugh with, cry with, live with, and cherish forever. From the moment I held my wife’s hand at our wedding, to the moment I first held my son’s tiny fingers, to times when I’ve worked hand in hand with peers across responsibilities, geographies and incredible achievements, it’s always people who have touched my heart and pushed me forward. Now it’s time to leave HP, this place I’ve called home for the past 33 years, (I’ll stick with my wife), and I find myself reflecting on this with, no regrets, the most fulfilling journey I’ve been on. I’m often asked how I planned my family. I have three sons and two daughters (boy, girl, boy, girl, boy in that order!). I might joke that it requires “disciplined linearity, perfect delivery mix, a resilient supply chain management strategy and a focus on new product development” 😊, however there’s no predicting family. In contrast, for work I have come to appreciate the maxim: plan your work, work your plan and your plan will work - where this approach also translates to my career, I have always believed that you should be thinking two jobs ahead. Your next role is a stepping-stone to where you want to go, what you want to achieve. I’m lucky in that HP strongly believes in career development and rotation. I’ve done 16 jobs over 3 decades. I set out my career in 1989 as a Financial Analyst in our Far East HQ, Hong Kong. Here I am. By 1997 I was running Indonesia in Jakarta, and as the financing manager for Asia Pacific and Japan before being promoted to be the Marketing VP for our region with responsibility to play a lead role for the HP-Compaq merger. Running towards the fire. Running towards the fire has learning upsides! As a young country GM for Indonesia, I had to manage through the 1998 May Riots, which was one of Indonesia’s most turbulent and ugly chapters in its history. Navigating through this crisis taught me many valuable lessons in business and people management, which has served me well through many other difficult times in my career. We should not be afraid to run towards and tackle the many fires we face. From there I was head of Channel Sales, head of Enterprise Sales, Managing Director for South East Asia, Taiwan, HK & Korea and then Head of Print for the region. Using a football analogy, I started my footballing career as a substitute, I have played in defense, in midfield and as a striker. I believe this experience set me up for the eventual coaching position. I knew the roles, the positions, and the plays. Part of my longevity at HP is the opportunity to experience these different positions, it matched my philosophy of planning two jobs ahead and provided a clear view of where I wanted, and was given the opportunity, to go. If only planning a family was so easy. Yet both require building strong teams. Whether it’s Team TC or Team HP, allowing individuals to grow and build themselves into strong and confident members of that team is critical to success and happiness. As my kids grew up, I have had to influence and shape their development, education and career choices too. Fortunately, my business war stories, analogies and the HP Way approach to culture served me well on the home front 😊 In an increasingly VULCA world, the analogy I often use recently is that of a jazz leader. Rather than conduct an orchestra to rigid time and mood, a jazz leader may have no script, gives free reign within parameters to allow each musician to excel at what they do best. I’ve had to accept that I cannot be the expert in everything. Successful managers are like great jazz leaders. We need to accept living at the edge of discomfort and be comfortable with change. It means challenging our assumptions and committing ourselves to constant learning. I’ve been at HP for more than 30 years and every day I’m learning something new. The time is over for reacting to what is now reality, and move forward to accepting, preparing and meeting uncertainty without fear. This has informed my decision to move on. Yet there is something else. Another commitment I made over this past 30 and more years, was to serve in the Singapore Army Reserve/National Service in senior leadership roles. I am very proud of this region, filled with a young and dynamic population filled to the brim with potential. A strong part of me wants to contribute to something bigger, the future growth of possibly the most exciting place in the world. That excitement comes with challenges and serving my country means I can contribute to the stability and safety of this incredible region. It’s my why, the why I bring to considering the family I want to be part of, the career I’ve experienced and the future challenges I want to face. My parting words would be: each and every day challenge your why. Stretch your imagination as to your possibilities. Adopt a global mindset and think about what it is you bring to that vast table of opportunity. Never be afraid to ask questions. Finally, I want you to watch this video of our recent HP Alumni event.

as a young country gm for indonesia, i had to manage through the 1998 may riots, which was one of indonesias most turbulent and ugly chapters in its history. navigating through this crisis taught me many valuable lessons in business and people management, which has served me well through many other difficult times in my career. we should not be afraid to run towards and tackle the many fires we face. from there i was head of channel sales, head of enterprise sales, managing director for south east asia, taiwan, hk  korea and then head of print for the region. using a football analogy, i started my footballing career as a substitute, i have played in defense, in midfield and as a striker. i believe this experience set me up for the eventual coaching position. i knew the roles, the positions, and the plays. part of my longevity at hp is the opportunity to experience these different positions, it matched my philosophy of planning two jobs ahead and provided a clear view of where i wanted, and was given the opportunity, to go. if only planning a family was so easy. yet both require building strong teams. whether its team tc or team hp, allowing individuals to grow and build themselves into strong and confident members of that team is critical to success and happiness. as my kids grew up, i have had to influence and shape their development, education and career choices too. fortunately, my business war stories, analogies and the hp way approach to culture served me well on the home front in an increasingly vulca world, the analogy i often use recently is that of a jazz leader. rather than conduct an orchestra to rigid time and mood, a jazz leader may have no script, gives free reign within parameters to allow each musician to excel at what they do best. ive had to accept that i cannot be the expert in everything. successful managers are like great jazz leaders. we need to accept living at the edge of discomfort and be comfortable with change. it means challenging our assumptions and committing ourselves to constant learning. ive been at hp for more than 30 years and every day im learning something new. the time is over for reacting to what is now reality, and move forward to accepting, preparing and meeting uncertainty without fear. this has informed my decision to move on. yet there is something else. another commitment i made over this past 30 and more years, was to serve in the singapore army reservenational service in senior leadership roles. i am very proud of this region, filled with a young and dynamic population filled to the brim with potential. a strong part of me wants to contribute to something bigger, the future growth of possibly the most exciting place in the world. that excitement comes with challenges and serving my country means i can contribute to the stability and safety of this incredible region. its my why, the why i bring to considering the family i want to be part of, the career ive experienced and the future challenges i want to face. my parting words would be: each and every day challenge your why. stretch your imagination as to your possibilities. adopt a global mindset and think about what it is you bring to that vast table of opportunity. never be afraid to ask questions. finally, i want you to watch this video of our recent hp alumni event. im proud to join this distinguished set of achievers. they speak to the impact a career at hp provides. it will never leave me. thank you each and every one of you.",-15,too_long,in 1989 i made two momentous decisions,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,9,51,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,12,2,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,94,94

What actually stands out? The ones who create a unique impact, even if it's just for a small group of people. I asked those questions to my coaching clients, and you can ask yourself:: - What hard thing are you doing just to prove you can — that you could let go of? - What advantage (location, family support, natural skills) are you not using? - What would your life look like if you optimized for your zone of genius instead of constantly challenging yourself?

avr27,"In my last NLP post regarding NMT(Neural Machine Translation), I shared about its architecture in a very intuitive manner. I shared about Encoder, Context Vector, and Decoder . 🔗 Post Link 🔗 Article Link(NMT Architecture) At the end of the article, I said we could add Attention Mechanism to our decoder. So, let's continue from there. The next step of our journey takes us to one of the most important concepts in machine learning, 'Attention' . So far, the decoder had to rely on the encoder's last state as the 'only' input/signal about the source language. This is like asking to summarize a sentence using a single word. Generally, when doing so, you lose a lot of the meaning and message in this conversion. Attention alleviates this problem. Instead of relying just on the encoder's last state, attention enables the decoder to analyze the complete history of the encoder's state outputs. The decoder does this at every step of the prediction and creates a weighted average of all the state outputs depending on what it needs to produce at that step. For example, in the translation from English to German, I went to the shop -> ich ging zum Laden, when predicting the word ging, the decoder will pay more attention to the first part of the English sentence than the latter. ➡️ The context/thought vector is a performance bottleneck As we have seen in the encoder-decoder architecture of NMT, the encoder part spits out a summarized representation of the source language sentence as 'context/thought vector', which basically creates a link b/w the encoder and the decoder, which later the decoder uses to translate the sentence. To understand why the context/thought vector is a performance bottleneck , Let's imagine translating the following English sentence: I went to the flower market to buy some flowers This translates to the following: Ich ging zum Blumenmarkt, um Blumen zu kaufen If we are to compress this into a fixed-length vector, the resulting vector needs to contain these: 1. Information about the subject (I) 2. Information about the verbs (buy and went) 3. Information about the objects (flowers and flower market) 4. Interaction of the subjects, verbs, and objects with each other in the sentence Generally, the context vector has a size of 128 or 256 elements. Reliance on the context vector to store all this information with a small-sized vector is very impractical and an extremely difficult requirement for the system. Therefore, most of the time, the context vector fails to provide the complete information required to make a good translation. This results in an underperforming decoder that suboptimally translates a sentence. To make the problem worse, during decoding the context vector is observed only in the beginning. Thereafter, the decoder GRU must memorize the context vector until the end of the translation. This becomes more and more difficult for long sentences. ➡️ How does Attention deal with this issue? Attention sidesteps this issue: With attention, the decoder will have access to the full state history of the encoder for each decoding time step. This allows the decoder to access a very rich representation of the source sentence. Furthermore, the attention mechanism introduces a softmax layer that allows the decoder to calculate a weighted mean of the past observed encoder states, which will be used as the context vector for the decoder. This allows the decoder to pay different amounts of attention to different words at different decoding steps. Conceptual Breakdown of the Attention Mechanism: ➡️ The Bahdanau Attention Mechanism (Also called Additive Attention) The Bahdanau attention mechanism is introduced in the paper Neural Machine Translation by Learning to Jointly Align and Translate , by Dzmitry Bahdanau . The attention mechanism was introduced to address the bottleneck problem that arises with the use of a fixed-length encoding vector, where the decoder would have limited access to the information provided by the input. This is thought to become especially problematic for long and/or complex sequences, where the dimensionality of their representation would be forced to be the same as for shorter or simpler sequences. ✅ Simple & Intuitive Explanation of Bahdanau Attention: The Bahdanau Attention Mechanism, also known as Additive Attention , is like a spotlight that helps a machine learning model focus on the most relevant parts of a long piece of information when making decisions, just like how you pay attention to different words when reading a sentence. Here's a simple and intuitive explanation: Imagine you're translating a sentence from one language to another, and the sentence is quite long. Bahdanau Attention is like having a little assistant who highlights specific words in the original sentence for you as you translate. The Sentence: Let's say you have a long sentence in a foreign language you want to translate, like ""The big blue car drove quickly down the winding mountain road."" The Assistant: Your Bahdanau Attention assistant looks at each word in the sentence and decides which words are the most important for you to pay attention to while translating. Highlighting: It highlights certain words, like ""big,"" ""blue,"" and ""car,"" which are the key pieces of information for understanding the sentence. Translating: As you translate, you focus more on the highlighted words, so you might say something like, ""The important thing here is that there's a big blue car."" You give extra importance to those highlighted words because they carry the crucial details. Dynamic Attention: What's cool is that the assistant can change its highlights for different sentences. If the next sentence is, ""The small red bicycle went slowly up the steep hill,"" it will highlight different words like ""small,"" ""red,"" and ""bicycle."" In summary, Bahdanau Attention is like having a helpful spotlight that guides you through understanding and translating sentences by emphasizing the important words. It's a way for machines to focus on the relevant parts of information when processing sequences of data, making them more efficient and accurate in tasks like translation, summarization, and more.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"When the pandemic hit, I noticed something very distinct about online calls compared to meeting in real life. I’m a people person, I like to gauge the room, perhaps speak to participants before. Essentially do a recon and be armed with context around the meeting. This isn’t possible online, and I was reminded of a lesson I’ve learned throughout my career; the need to speak up. Early in my career, my natural inclination was to sit back and observe and then speak rather than make proactive points early in the conversation. The need to speak up is even more pertinent now. This year’s IWD reminds us that progress in gender equality is still painfully slow. Alarmingly the pandemic has made the battle for equality even tougher. The World Economic Forum (WEF) reported last year that the pandemic has actually widened gender inequality across Asia and the world. Currently, the WEF predict it will take another 135 years for the world to achieve true gender parity versus 99 years which was the prediction prior to the pandemic. In addition, a report by Catalyst shares that nearly 50% of women business leaders find it hard to speak up during Zoom calls and 1 in 3 can feel ignored or overlooked on calls. Working in a multinational, I had to make conscious decisions to overcome my natural inclinations, especially when the general image of a leader is one is extroverted, extremely vocal, frequently challenging views. Although this image doesn’t necessarily match reality, it is one that is pervasive in popular, culture, in media, in the workplace. Unfortunately, research shows that when women do this, they can be perceived negatively compared to men. In a study asking U.S. Naval Academy students to rate attributes from negative to positive, women received more negative attributes and these attributes tended to be those we associate with women. This spills over into the workplace. We expect leaders and females to act in certain ways and those may not be compatible in our mind despite clearly being compatible in reality. This year, International Women’s Day featured the theme #breakthebias. To quote directly from the IWD mission: Whether deliberate or unconscious, bias makes it difficult for women to move ahead. Knowing that bias exists isn’t enough. Action is needed to level the playing field and the first step is to speak out. McKinsey research shows that companies leading the way in executive diversity were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than companies lagging behind, while companies with more than 30% female executives were more likely to outperform companies that are predominately male. Bias, no matter how minor, conscious or unconscious can be powerfully harmful. And sometimes we don’t notice things until they’re made apparent to us. It’s one thing to recognize the numbers and statistics, it’s another to think about how we address the issue. For me, I believe that to #breakthebias requires us to #speakup first. It was this insight that helped me get past my own self-consciousness and doubt, and ultimately change the way others perceived me. It took work. While there’s no way that I can compare my own journey to today’s challenge of gender bias, forcing myself to speak up has been a valuable lesson in making clear to me what is needed to drive change and overcome unfair perceptions and stereotyping in society today. It may not be in our natures to speak out, but we cannot defer to others so easily. Opportunities to be heard are more fleeting today as airtime is limited on Zoom calls. As a leader I need to sway opinion, fight for resource or more support, I had to be heard and then be bullet-proof in my case. Part of speaking up can lay in preparing better allowing one to be consistent and confident in what you say. One area that has helped is engaging in public speaking as you have to prepare beforehand. It also helps to overcome nervousness about speaking up. Everyone feels nerves and uncertainty in such situations. Sportspeople often say how nerves is a good sign – nerves help focus them on the task at hand. So they put in hours of practice to perform. And leadership takes different forms, leadership also means giving others the opportunity and confidence to speak up as well. I’ve come to believe modern leadership isn’t being the orchestra conductor at the center of the attention, but a jazz leader allowing each individual to sound out their part. The goal is to make operating at the edge of discomfort a normal state of affairs. It’s tough to start but it gets easier. Pushing myself helped me become concise, more consistent, more credible with audience and peers. Regardless of bias or past perceptions, respect and parity can still be earned. At HP we’ve made it a core mission to drive greater equality for women and people of all backgrounds. Today, our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is made up of 50% total minorities, 33% women and 25% underrepresented minorities. For women, the opportunities at HP for career advancement are growing each year. Our Women in Leadership Lab (WILL) is a 7-month leadership program aimed at providing women with the appropriate hard and soft skills to take on leadership roles, as well as rotations across our functions and business units. But this is just the beginning. More can be done and more must be done to break our own biases and those of society. But it all starts with each of us today. What bias do you or those close to you face? And what can you do to overcome it? This March, on International Women’s Month. Let’s #SpeakUp. But let’s also recognize that leadership comes in many forms and that we need to recognize and work on our own biases while working to collectively

forcing myself to speak up has been a valuable lesson in making clear to me what is needed to drive change and overcome unfair perceptions and stereotyping in society today. it may not be in our natures to speak out, but we cannot defer to others so easily. opportunities to be heard are more fleeting today as airtime is limited on zoom calls. as a leader i need to sway opinion, fight for resource or more support, i had to be heard and then be bullet-proof in my case. part of speaking up can lay in preparing better allowing one to be consistent and confident in what you say. one area that has helped is engaging in public speaking as you have to prepare beforehand. it also helps to overcome nervousness about speaking up. everyone feels nerves and uncertainty in such situations. sportspeople often say how nerves is a good sign  nerves help focus them on the task at hand. so they put in hours of practice to perform. and leadership takes different forms, leadership also means giving others the opportunity and confidence to speak up as well. ive come to believe modern leadership isnt being the orchestra conductor at the center of the attention, but a jazz leader allowing each individual to sound out their part. the goal is to make operating at the edge of discomfort a normal state of affairs. its tough to start but it gets easier. pushing myself helped me become concise, more consistent, more credible with audience and peers. regardless of bias or past perceptions, respect and parity can still be earned. at hp weve made it a core mission to drive greater equality for women and people of all backgrounds. today, our executive leadership team elt is made up of 50 total minorities, 33 women and 25 underrepresented minorities. for women, the opportunities at hp for career advancement are growing each year. our women in leadership lab will is a 7-month leadership program aimed at providing women with the appropriate hard and soft skills to take on leadership roles, as well as rotations across our functions and business units. but this is just the beginning. more can be done and more must be done to break our own biases and those of society. but it all starts with each of us today. what bias do you or those close to you face? and what can you do to overcome it? this march, on international womens month. lets #speakup. but lets also recognize that leadership comes in many forms and that we need to recognize and work on our own biases while working to collectively #breakthebias.",-15,too_long,"when the pandemic hit, i noticed something very

avr27,"Here is something that I picked up along the way on how we can improve our predictions of LSTM networks, specifically regarding Language Modelling, i.e., Generating Text. Here are some techniques that help LSTMs perform better at the prediction stage: Greedy Sampling , Beam Search , Word Embeddings : Using Word Vectors instead of a one-hot-encoded representation of words, and Using bidirectional LSTMs NOTE: These optimization techniques are not specific to LSTMs; rather, any sequential model can benefit from them. Now, let's understand them in the context of Language Modelling, Scenario: Let's assume that our LSTM network is trained on a corpus of text data, and given an initial set of words, it can predict subsequent words, making sense like a story. Problem: If we try always to predict the next word with the highest probability, the LSTM will tend to produce very monotonic results. For example, due to the frequent occurrence of stop words (e.g., is, the), it may repeat them many times before switching to another word. Solutions: Greedy Sampling: One way to get around this is to use greedy sampling, where we pick the predicted best n and sample from that set. This helps to break the monotonic nature of the predictions. For e.g.: Suppose we have a sentence 'Amit is learning Natural Language Processing' . Given the first word, 'Amit', and we want our LSTM network to predict the subsequent words. If we attempt to choose samples deterministically, the LSTM might output something like the following: 'Amit is learning is Natural learning' However, by sampling the next word from a subset of words in the vocabulary (most highly probable ones), the LSTM is forced to vary the prediction and might output the desired sentence with a respectable probability or something similar like: 'Amit is learning Processing Natural Language'. However, although greedy sampling helps add more flavor/diversity to the generated text, this method does not guarantee that the output will always be realistic, especially when outputting longer text sequences. Next comes: Beam Search: In this, the predictions are found by solving a search problem. Particularly, we predict several steps ahead for multiple candidates at each step. This gives rise to a tree-like structure with candidate sequences of words. The crucial idea of beam search is to produce the 'b' outputs simultaneously instead of a single output. We are looking farther into the future before making a prediction, which usually leads to better results. Here, 'b' is known as the length of the beam, and the 'b' outputs produced are known as the beam. Bidirectional LSTMs: Making LSTMs bidirectional is another way of improving the quality of the predictions of an LSTM. By this, we mean training the LSTM with text read in both directions: from the beginning to the end and the end to the beginning. Other variants of LSTMs include Peephole connections, GRUs, etc. If you are interested in delving deeper into understanding these concepts, consider checking out my notebooks: 🔗 Notebook on Understanding LSTM & Improving Predictions in Language Modelling. In one of the previous posts, I shared about neutral networks like RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs, which are explicitly used for text data.

alexchriss,"March is in full swing, which means you’re probably starting to sweat this year's April 17 tax deadline. Small business taxes can be overwhelming, but they’re an unavoidable part of the entrepreneurial experience. Fortunately, with careful planning and the right preparation, the tax process can be straightforward and pain-free. I recently reached out to Juventino Gaytan, Christi Shields, Lynn Addison Gross, Ben Taylor and Becky Neilson – seasoned tax professionals and ProAdvisors from the Intuit QuickBooks community. With their input, here are five things you should do to best prepare for the tax deadline and maximize your returns: 1. Keep your records up-to-date. Record-keeping is the single most critical part of the tax preparation process, since everything in your tax return must have the necessary supporting documentation. Keep records up-to-date and organized throughout the year – including receipts, bank and credit card statements, bills and invoices. Accounting programs like QuickBooks can help you track all types of business expenses. In whatever system you use to manage records, be sure to categorize all transactions by their type (i.e. “facilities,” “maintenance,” “travel,” etc.) so they report properly on your profit and loss statements. For transactions of $500 or more, recording the type of asset, date of purchase and price will help your tax preparer get you the proper deductions. 2. Look for a preparer with small business savvy. Most small business owners choose to navigate the complicated world of taxes with the support of an accounting professional (bonus: accounting fees are tax deductible!). If you do decide to go with an expert, find a preparer with expertise in small business taxes. What’s more, look for someone who has experience doing tax returns for your specific business type: LLC, S Corporation or C Corporation. A professional with regular experience in your specific area will be able to better help you maximize your deductions and assist with ongoing tax planning. 3. Stay in touch with your preparer throughout the year. Once you have a professional on board, stay close with them throughout the year – not just in advance of big deadlines. Give them access to your bookkeeping system so that as business decisions are being made there is data to support that action. Maintain an open line of communication with your preparer and be sure to talk with them before making any big decisions like a purchase or lease. They’ll help you understand the tax implications, make informed decisions, and may be able to reduce your tax liabilities. 4. Don’t forget about quarterly taxes! Most small businesses are required to pay estimated tax payments each quarter, since taxes such as Social Security aren’t being withheld from wages or other payments as they would for a W-2 employee. The IRS offers a helpful calendar tool for small business owners that sends reminder notifications one to two weeks before a payment is due. Because these deadlines roll around every four months, it’s important to set aside money on a regular basis to cover the payments and avoid interest payments or penalties. Staying on top of this process is key, as come April you’ll have to be pay the balance of taxes if you did not pay quarterly. If you think your tax bill for 2017 will total more than $1,000 and your total withholdings are less than 90 percent of the total federal tax you expect to pay at the end of the year, the IRS will expect you to start paying your taxes quarterly rather than yearly. 5. Calculate your taxes in advance. Calculating your taxable income as a business owner early in the year will help prepare you for tax deadlines and avoid any surprises along the way. To do this, take your annual gross income—the total revenue you received—and deduct expenses, and any deductions you’re eligible for. This will give you an idea of the estimate for the taxes you’ll owe for the year (and when divided by four, the quarterly payments you’ll need to make). There are also plenty of online tools that can do this for you. This simple process will ensure you kick-off tax season more informed and better prepared to make the required payments. April 17th is just around the corner, but there’s no reason to fear. Staying organized throughout the year, seeking the help of an expert, and anticipating deadlines and payments means you’ll be able to tackle tax season with the same tenacity that drives your business day-to-day.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"One thing is for certain: none of us will ever forget 2020. But as we shift into the new year, I believe we will look back on 2020 as a catalyst for change, where new challenges ignited a new era of innovation. As McKinsey says in a recent report , “Crises are like adrenaline for innovation, causing barriers that once took years to overcome to evaporate in a matter of days.” That’s especially true when you consider how the pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of new and emerging technologies. We’re certainly seeing that at HP. At HP’s recent Innovation Summit 2020, our top researchers showcased the rapid progress we are making in the application of two key technologies: 3D printing and microfluidics. The latter, for those unfamiliar with the technology, enables fluids to be handled in new ways at a microscopic level. These two technologies have the potential to reshape industries ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. Manufacturing personalized products at scale 3D printing, for example, is one of the digital technologies that is enabling businesses address one of their biggest challenges of 2020 – disrupted supply chains. I have talked previously about how businesses are aiming to improve supply chain resilience through decentralization and moving services closer to customers. HP’s recent Digital Manufacturing Trend Report showed that 97 percent of Singaporean manufacturing executives are investigating new production or supply chain models. Digital technologies such as 3D printing offer the automation and flexibility needed for these new models, by enabling manufacturers to change how and where things are made. At HP, we’ve seen a big surge in interest in 3D printing. For example, 3D printing has helped alleviate severe shortages of medical items such as face masks and ventilator components during the pandemic. 3D printing can also deliver exciting innovation capabilities. We’re starting to see big data and 3D printing used together to deliver mass personalization – or, in other words, making products designed for individuals at scale. For instance, Horizons Optical uses 3D printing and its own software to offer fully customizable eyewear . The solution starts with taking a 3D scan of the customer’s face, allowing them to virtually ‘try on’ frames. It then changes the shape of the selected frame to ensure it fits the customer’s face perfectly, before the glasses are ‘printed’. In addition, HP is continuing to invest our resources and R&D expertise to help develop new, future-ready manufacturing technologies and techniques. We launched the HP-NTU Digital Manufacturing Corporate Lab in Singapore, in partnership with the Nanyang Technological University and the Singapore Government’s National Research Foundation. Accelerating medical breakthroughs with microfluidics Meanwhile, microfluidics is helping to accelerate breakthroughs in fields such as medical research. Originally developed by HP for printing, we have invested billions of dollars into researching and developing the underlying technology over the past three decades. We can now place fluid as small as one-fifth the size of a human cell exactly where we want it. These developments have enabled us to take microfluidics into new domains. HP’s Specialty Printing Systems team is working on using microfluidics for non-invasive biopsies of cancer cells and ‘printing’ pharmaceutical samples . The team recently worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States on accelerating the testing of new antibiotics to fight antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Through its ability to handle tiny amounts of fluids with great precision and speed, microfluidics also offers the potential to greatly accelerate COVID-19 testing. With millions of COVID-19 tests still being conducted globally every day, current testing regimes are at, or even beyond, the limits of their capacity. Delays in receiving test results continue to disrupt people’s lives and businesses. Microfluidics, however, could allow frontline healthcare workers to use small, highly portable testing devices to complete diagnostic tests on the spot – at a medical center, in an office, or even at someone’s home. It could reduce processing time from days to minutes. People returning negative results could go back to work or school, or resume their travel, immediately. Research into using microfluidics for COVID-19 testing is well underway at several organizations, such as the University of Michigan and Dolomite Microfluidics and Mologic . Towards a brighter, healthier future As well as healthcare, microfluidics has great potential for applications in agriculture, forensics, water testing, and environmental screening. At HP, we will continue our work in unlocking the potential of technologies such as microfluidics and 3D printing – just as we have for the past 80 years. In fact, innovation has never been more important than it is now. Our aim is to accelerate our innovation initiatives and, along with other like-minded organizations, deliver a safer, brighter future for

we will look back on 2020 as a catalyst for change, where new challenges ignited a new era of innovation. as mckinsey says in a recent report , crises are like adrenaline for innovation, causing barriers that once took years to overcome to evaporate in a matter of days. thats especially true when you consider how the pandemic has accelerated the development and adoption of new and emerging technologies. were certainly seeing that at hp. at hps recent innovation summit 2020, our top researchers showcased the rapid progress we are making in the application of two key technologies: 3d printing and microfluidics. the latter, for those unfamiliar with the technology, enables fluids to be handled in new ways at a microscopic level. these two technologies have the potential to reshape industries ranging from manufacturing to healthcare. manufacturing personalized products at scale 3d printing, for example, is one of the digital technologies that is enabling businesses address one of their biggest challenges of 2020  disrupted supply chains. i have talked previously about how businesses are aiming to improve supply chain resilience through decentralization and moving services closer to customers. hps recent digital manufacturing trend report showed that 97 percent of singaporean manufacturing executives are investigating new production or supply chain models. digital technologies such as 3d printing offer the automation and flexibility needed for these new models, by enabling manufacturers to change how and where things are made. at hp, weve seen a big surge in interest in 3d printing. for example, 3d printing has helped alleviate severe shortages of medical items such as face masks and ventilator components during the pandemic. 3d printing can also deliver exciting innovation capabilities. were starting to see big data and 3d printing used together to deliver mass personalization  or, in other words, making products designed for individuals at scale. for instance, horizons optical uses 3d printing and its own software to offer fully customizable eyewear . the solution starts with taking a 3d scan of the customers face, allowing them to virtually try on frames. it then changes the shape of the selected frame to ensure it fits the customers face perfectly, before the glasses are printed. in addition, hp is continuing to invest our resources and rd expertise to help develop new, future-ready manufacturing technologies and techniques. we launched the hp-ntu digital manufacturing corporate lab in singapore, in partnership with the nanyang technological university and the singapore governments national research foundation. accelerating medical breakthroughs with microfluidics meanwhile, microfluidics is helping to accelerate

avr27,"Layer Norm, Batch Norm & Covariate Shift: Continuing from my last post on batch normalization , Here are a few things on layer normalization, that are helpful in working with neural network architectures like Transformers, RNNs, and feedforward networks. Why LayerNorm? Problems with BatchNorm: Most of the issue with Batch Norm arises due to its dependency on batch size while training the network. Hard to use with Sequence Data: as sequences are of varying length, making calculations difficult Doesn't work well with small batch sizes: Since Batch Norm calculates mean & variance for batches of data, thus mean & variance over small batches wouldn't represent the overall data well. Parallelization: Cannot parallelize the network while using Batch Norm. What is Layer Normalization? Layer normalization layer is similar to batch normalization , and is a way to reduce the covariate shift in neural networks, allowing them to be trained faster and achieve better performance. In simple terms, Covariate shift refers to changes in the distribution of neural network activations as it trains, caused by changes in the data distribution like scale, mean, variance, etc. Batch normalization computes the mean and variance of activations as an average over the samples in the batch, causing its performance to rely on mini-batches used to train the model. However, layer normalization computes the mean and variance (that is, the normalization terms) of the activations in such a way that the normalization terms are the same for every hidden unit in a layer. In other words, layer normalization has a single mean and a variance value for all the hidden units in a layer. This is in contrast to batch normalization, which maintains individual mean and variance values for each hidden unit in a layer. Moreover, unlike batch normalization, layer normalization does not average over the samples in the batch; instead, it leaves the averaging out and has different normalization terms for different inputs. By having a mean and variance per sample, layer normalization gets rid of the dependency on the mini-batch size. Benefits of Layer Norm: - can deal with sequences like RNNs - any batch number works - can parallelize Layer Norm doesn't work well with CNNs. Batch Norm is preferred in the case of CNNs. Visual Understanding: Covariate Shift: Covariate Shift refers to changes in the distribution of activations or features within a neural network as the model goes through training. In simpler terms, it's the phenomenon where the statistical properties of the i/p to a neural network change over time. This change can be caused by various factors, such as changes in the data distribution, changes in the model's parameters, or the inherent non-stationarity of the data. For instance, during the training of a neural network, the distribution of data that it sees can change as the model adapts to new examples. This can lead to differences in the scale, mean, or variance of the activations within the network. When this happens, the network may need to continuously adapt to these changes, making training slower and less stable. 🔗Why Does Batch Norm Work? - Visual understanding of Covariate Shift, black cat, and colored cat example! by DeepLearning.AI Reducing Covariate Shift: Batch Normalization (BatchNorm): Batch normalization is a technique used to mitigate covariate shifts. It works by normalizing (scaling and shifting) the activations within each mini-batch of data during training. This helps stabilize the distribution of activations, making training more efficient and enabling the use of higher learning rates. Layer Normalization (LayerNorm): Layer normalization is similar to batch normalization but operates at a different level. While batch normalization normalizes activations across a mini-batch, layer normalization normalizes activations across the features at each layer. In other words, it normalizes the activations for a single training example, independently for each feature, rather than relying on statistics computed over a mini-batch. Benefits of Layer Normalization: Layer normalization offers several advantages: Reducing Covariate Shift: Layer normalization, like batch normalization, helps reduce the effects of covariate shift by ensuring that the mean and variance of the activations within each layer remain relatively constant during training. This stabilizes the training process. Independence from Batch Size: Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization is less dependent on the mini-batch size. It is often used in scenarios where batch sizes are small or even when processing single examples (like in RNNs). Applicability to Different Architectures: Layer normalization is used in a wide range of neural network architectures, including Transformers, RNNs, and feedforward networks. In summary, covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of neural network activations during training, can hinder the training process and negatively impact model performance. Techniques like layer normalization, by ensuring stable statistics of activations at each layer, help alleviate this problem and make training more efficient and effective, ultimately leading to better model performance.

lee-amelia,"Reflecting on a recent meaningful evening, one that reminded me of something simple, yet powerful: when a community comes together with intention, 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴 are changed. Thank you Endowus for inviting me, along with past and present SAGE Counselling Centre Board of Directors, management and fellow supporters, to the #EndowusGivesBack Fundraising Closing Gala Dinner. I’m deeply grateful to Community Chest Singapore for nominating SAGE Counselling Centre to Endowus as one of the beneficiaries of this meaningful initiative. Your continued belief in the work we do for seniors is truly appreciated. 🙏🏼 A special mention as well to Endowus Co-founder, Chairman and Group Chief Investiement Officer, Mr. Samuel Rhee and his team, whose passion and commitment have been instrumental in driving this initiative and rallying the community to give back in such a purposeful way. The evening was graced by the Guest of Honour, Mr Eric Chua , Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), as well as many like-minded corporate and community partners including MoneySmart Group , Airwallex , Azimut Group , First Sentier Group , Anapi , and supporting partners Community Chest Singapore , National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) , National Council of Social Service (NCSS) , Asiaray Media Group Limited and #StellarAce . But beyond the names and organisations, what truly stood out was the shared spirit in the room, a collective belief that giving back is not just a responsibility, but a privilege. 💙 It was heartening to hear that the 2025 Invest in Our Home campaign raised S$350,000 for the beneficiaries. 🙌🏼 As one of the beneficiaries, Sage Counselling Centre is incredibly grateful for this support. It will enable us to continue strengthening the mental and emotional wellbeing of seniors through counselling, helpline services, and active ageing initiatives. 🙏🏼 Many of us may not see it, but there are seniors quietly struggling, with loneliness, anxiety, grief, and emotional burdens that often go unspoken.

qi-han-wong-34955261,"I tracked my calories religiously for a week using a standard US-based app. By Friday, I had ""lost"" 1kg on paper but gained 0.5kg in reality. Why? Because the app saw my Bak Chor Mee and logged it as ""Pasta with Meat Sauce."" It missed the lard, the vinegar, and the sheer density of the sauce. For the sake of my waistline, I built HawkerSense , a localized AI vision app running on Gemini 3.0 Flash. It doesn't just identify food; it understands the context of a Singaporean hawker meal. Try it out here . The Problem: The ""Sauce Blindspot"" Most nutrition AI lacks local context. It sees ""Vegetables"" (healthy!) where any local sees ""Vegetables glazed in Oyster Sauce and Pork Lard"" (hidden calories!). Western models are trained on distinct, separated food items (steak, potatoes, salad). Hawker food is messy, mixed, and coated. I needed a model that could infer the invisible calories based on the visual cues of the dish. Essentially, an AI with ""Singaporean Intuition."" The Interesting Findings After testing the model on hundreds of hawker meals, three patterns emerged: The ""Gravy Multiplier"" is real. The model consistently flags that two visually identical bowls of Ban Mian can differ by 300kcal purely based on the ""sheen"" (oil reflection) on the soup surface. It learned to spot what I call the ""heart attack layer."" A dry version often clocks higher than soup versions simply due to the sauce density. ""Healthy"" is often a trap. We tend to think of anything green as safe. The model, however, aggressively flags stir-fried hawker vegetables as ""Nutri-Grade C"" (moderate) rather than ""A"" (healthy). It correctly assumes that in a commercial wok, ""stir-fry"" means ""high-heat oil bath."" It's a harsh correction, but statistically accurate. The Economy Rice Paradox. The most variance in any dish comes from Economy Rice ( Cai Fan ). The same ""2 Meat 1 Veg"" combo can vary wildly. The AI successfully identifies that the curry gravy poured over the rice—often invisible to standard object detectors—is the most calorie-dense item on the plate. The Approach: Context Injection I leveraged Google's Gemini 3.0 Flash . The trick wasn't the image recognition; it was the Context Injection . I engineered the system prompts to act not just as a nutritionist, but as a local. Prompting for ""Sheen"" : Explicitly asking the model to analyze light reflection to estimate oil content. The ""Honesty Box"" : AI hallucinates. Instead of hiding it, I built a UI feature called ""Blindspots."" If the AI sees a bowl of Laksa, it explicitly warns: ""I can't see the sugar content in this sambal, estimate +50kcal uncertainty."" Training a custom YOLO model would actually be the ""Gold Standard"" for real-time detection speed and bounding box accuracy. You need about 100-200 images per class (e.g., Wanton Mee, Chicken Rice, Prata) for a decent MVP. For 50 hawker dishes, that's ~5,000 images. However, I realised that Gemini 3.0 Flash had improved so much that it already recognises a large majority of the infinite variety of messy hawker food, allowing me to build this without managing a massive dataset. UX: Designing for Local Habits I didn't just want accurate data; I wanted an interface that felt native to a Singaporean user. The ""Plate Heat Map"" Instead of just drawing generic bounding boxes, the UI color-codes them based on health impact: Green (Safe), Orange (Moderate), and Red (Watch out). This creates an immediate visual hierarchy, allowing users to spot the ""danger zones"" of their meal—usually the curry-soaked rice or fried ikan bilis—milliseconds before reading the numbers. The Singlish Personality. A clinical ""High Fat Content"" warning is easy to ignore. A localized tip like ""Wah, a bit oily lah. Ask for less gravy next time!"" hits different. It turns the AI from a judge into a helpful buddy, making the advice more palatable and certainly more memorable than a standard nutrition label. The Tech Stack Backend : Gemini 3.0 Flash (Multimodal Vision) Frontend : Streamlit (Refactored with custom CSS for a Mobile-First, ""Card-Stack"" UI) Data Structure : Pydantic. This was crucial. It forces the LLM to output valid JSON—coordinates for bounding boxes, integers for macros—so we can render clean, reliable UI components instead of just text generation. Conclusion We can't change the food legacy of our hawker centers (and we shouldn't!), but we can change how we navigate it.

stephaniehillsphd,"Working hard got you here. It won’t get you promoted. Early in my career, I was invisible, not because I wasn’t working hard, but because I was waiting for permission to be seen. I told myself staying humble was right. Good work gets recognized. Speaking up felt arrogant So I kept my head down. Took on more. Delivered results. Assumed someone would notice. They didn’t. Review after review: No promotion. No “well done.” Just “keep doing what you’re doing.” The problem wasn’t my work. It was my silence. Silence doesn’t earn you a seat at the table. It erases you from it. So I changed. Led conversations. Spoke about impact. Made my value visible. That’s when everything shifted. I was promoted. Led a global engineering team. Finally felt valued. Now I teach this: Promotions don’t go to the hardest worker. They go to the person who makes their value unmistakable. 💥 10 MISTAKES BLOCKING YOUR PROMOTION And what to say instead... 1️⃣ “I’m too busy to take on more.” → Promotions favor impact, not overload ✅ “I’ve been freeing up time for higher-impact projects.” 2️⃣ “That’s not my job.” → Shows ownership beyond your scope ✅ “I’d be happy to help define how we can bridge that gap.” 3️⃣ “I just follow the process.” → Leaders promote problem-solvers, not rule-followers ✅ “Here’s how I improved the process.” 4️⃣ “I’ll wait for direction.” → Initiative signals leadership readiness ✅ “Here’s what I’ve already started exploring.” 5️⃣ “I’m waiting for recognition.” → You own your narrative. Leaders don’t promote invisible wins. ✅ “I keep my impact visible across teams.” 6️⃣ “I haven’t thought about my next step.” → Lack of vision signals you’re not ready to lead. ✅ “Here’s the direction I’m growing toward.” 7️⃣ “I’m fine staying where I am.” → Comfort doesn’t inspire confidence in leadership potential. ✅ “I love my role, and I’m ready for the next challenge.” 8️⃣ “I do everything myself.” → Promotion requires leverage, not heroics. ✅ “I’ve built systems and delegated effectively.” 9️⃣ “I don’t like managing people.” → Promotions are about multiplying impact through others ✅ “I’m learning how to empower others to do their best work.” 🔟 “I don’t handle politics.” → Influence isn’t politics. It’s leadership currency ✅ “I build relationships that move things forward.” Visibility got me promoted. But in 2026, visibility alone isn’t enough. The leaders getting promoted now are visible and AI-ready. If you want the next promotion, get AI-ready.

alexchriss,"Today, we took a big step into e-commerce with QuickBooks® Commerce , a business management platform to help small businesses attract and sell to new customers across multiple channels. I wanted to share some thoughts with you about why we made this leap. We spend a lot of time thinking about how small businesses compete in the world of AI, automation, and cloud computing. Big businesses have a built-in edge — they can afford expensive tech. Our mission, the thing that drives us every day, is finding new ways to help small businesses like yours compete, even when you can’t hire any extra people. We want to help you compete by creating and then getting your businesses access to similar tools. One of the areas we’ve been focused on, especially as COVID-19 has taken its toll on the small business landscape, is the need for a single tool that helps users acquire customers for their businesses and understand the most effective channels for growth. The need has become acute — something I felt after speaking to one of our customers. Freddie Hewett runs Stag Coffee – he sells coffee, prepared meals, and coffee accessories at his two stores. When COVID-19 hit, he instantly lost all foot traffic. But Stag Coffee has a strong social presence via Facebook and a WordPress website, so Freddie pivoted his business online. He began taking grocery orders from the local community and delivering safely to their doors. Freddie put up a list of products that he could sell on his website with an email address to send requests to. And that worked – for about a week. His basic website didn’t provide real time inventory and didn’t connect with his point of sale, so he’s literally tracking everything – every sale and every order – on a spreadsheet. Demand is high, but the spreadsheet is not in real time. In his words, it’s a nightmare. Freddie has all the ingredients for success: two stores with point of sale, a strong social presence, a website, and a simple product catalogue. But, he needs a flexible storefront, real-time tracking of inventory, multi-channel management, and order management – all of the complex commerce capabilities needed to replace his spreadsheet and unlock his growth. QuickBooks’ vision is to give our customers one integrated platform to centrally run and manage their small business. Our solution — QuickBooks Commerce — helps our customers sell across multiple sales channels including online storefronts, marketplaces, and POS systems. QuickBooks already had the financial, capital, and employee management capabilities to help our customers understand their business. Now we can help offline small businesses make the leap to digital e-commerce, and help mid-market and enterprise companies build out their omnichannel capabilities. As your business grows and you want to expand to new channels, we’ll have integrations and collaborations ready to go so you can expand without the complexity of managing a new channel. Amazon, ShopKeep, Squarespace and dozens more are already on board. Your listings, products, inventory, and orders will all be in sync. Because everything is tied together, you’ll be able to see data on profitability insights, ROI on marketing spend, new opportunities to expand your product line. And if you have questions – in the future, we plan to leverage our expert platform to not only help you with your bookkeeping, but connect you with an expert to optimize your shopping cart, or help you expand into new social channels. It’s a big step into e-commerce for us, but we think it’s our duty, because we know an open platform can become the source of truth to grow your business. At QuickBooks, we’ve been your trusted partner in managing complexity for more than 25 years. We began by helping you manage your books and grew into a platform that helps you get paid fast, manage capital, and pay employees with confidence. When COVID-19 upended the small business community, we used our fintech experience to help our customers get more than $1 billion in Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans. At every stage of your business, we want to help simplify your business. Now we’ll do the same for omnichannel customer growth.

qi-han-wong-34955261,"I got into a fight with my partner last week. Afterward, I journaled my thoughts to parse how I was feeling, and opened up a Gemini voice session to vent (very useful mirror - try it!). I also ran a summary of my conversation in a standard sentiment analysis tool to see what it could tell me about my emotional state. The verdict? Positive 😊 (78% confidence). Why? Because I said ""I'm fine"" and ""It's okay"" 3 times to avoid the topic. Download Beside on iOS: App Store 🤖 Android users: We're in Google's 14-day review period. Join the waitlist to get early access when we launch: https://wongqihan.com/beside The Problem: AI as an Echo Chamber There's a fundamental bug in how humans communicate during conflict. Linguists call it the difference between semantics (literal meaning) and pragmatics (contextual meaning). Here's how it plays out: Partner A says: ""The kitchen is messy."" Intent: ""I'm overwhelmed and need help."" Partner B hears: ""You're lazy and failing."" This gap is invisible to standard AI. Most sentiment models are single-perspective —they analyze what one person said, not how it landed: Input: ""I'm fine."" Analysis: Based on the words alone, ""fine"" = neutral-positive in 80% of internet data Result: Positive sentiment ✅ But the model never saw the other side. It didn't see Partner B's withdrawal. It became a bias-reinforcement machine, not a translator. The Solution: Dual-Stream Context Analysis With Beside , I stopped trying to analyze sentences and started analyzing streams . I engineered a ""Dual-Perspective"" prompt architecture using Gemini 3.0 Flash Preview . Instead of feeding the AI a single text block, I pass two distinct, parallel transcripts: PartnerA_Transcript PartnerB_Transcript This gives the AI a synthetic ""Theory of Mind."" By forcing it to read both transcripts simultaneously, the model can simulate Partner B's internal state (""They felt unheard"") based on Partner A's external output (""I'm fine""). It models the interaction , not just the words. The Geometry of Conflict Recording a fight sounds weird. I know. But here's the design decision that made it work: one device, placed between you. You're not recording each other. You're both speaking to a third object. This shifts the posture from ""me vs. you"" to ""us vs. the problem."" Facing off amplifies defensiveness. Sitting side-by-side, facing the same direction, externalizes the conflict. You're no longer opponents—you're co-investigators trying to decode what just happened. Does it feel unnatural the first time? Yes. But so does using Google Translate in a foreign country. By the second conversation, couples report it feels less confrontational than regular arguing. The 3 Variables I Engineered After testing on hundreds of conversations, I identified three critical variables that standard NLP misses: 1. The ""Heard-As"" Variable In the code, I force the model to output a variable called heardAs for every statement. Example: Partner A says: ""I feel like we're just roommates."" Partner B hears: ""You're not romantic enough."" By explicitly asking for the perceived meaning, the app bypasses literal sentiment entirely and map the actual emotional disconnect. 2. The Hidden Question Every defensive statement has an underlying vulnerability. I trained the prompt to extract the hiddenQuestion. Examples: Surface: ""You're always on your phone."" Hidden: ""Am I boring to you?"" Surface: ""Why are you always late?"" Hidden: ""Do I matter to you?"" The AI found that 80% of repetitive arguments are just variations of the same 3-5 core questions about worth, safety, and belonging. 3. Cycle Detection I don't just label individual emotions (""Anger,"" ""Sadness""). I label relationship dynamics . The model checks against known therapeutic patterns: Pursuer-Distancer: One pushes for resolution, the other retreats. Attack-Defend: Escalation and deflection in a loop. Demand-Withdraw: One asks for change, the other shuts down. This shift from ""What are they feeling?"" to ""What pattern are they stuck in?"" was the breakthrough. Why This Matters Standard relationship advice says ""Use I-statements"" and ""Listen actively."" That's useless advice when you're emotionally flooded. Your amygdala has hijacked your prefrontal cortex. You physically cannot listen in that state. Beside doesn't give advice. It translates. It takes the angry, defensive thing you just said (""You never help with anything!"") and shows you what it actually meant (""I feel overwhelmed and alone""). Then it shows your partner what they heard (""You think I'm useless""). The gap becomes visible. And once it's visible, you can fix it. The Red Line: What AI Cannot Do The app has a strict policy: Beside is a translator, not a therapist . Upon opening the app, users must acknowledge this limit. Why? Because AI is probabilistic. It can detect patterns (""You seem defensive""), but it cannot, and should not, diagnose pathology or intervene in abuse. I built specific safeguards: users must acknowledge these limits upon entry, and the app provide immediate access to crisis resources before any recording begins. Generative AI is powerful, but knowing when not to use it is the most important engineering decision made. Your Audio Stays on Your Device The first question everyone asks: ""Where does my recording go?"" Your audio never leaves your phone. Here's the exact flow: Record → Audio captured on-device Transcribe → Converted to text locally Analyze → Text sent to Gemini for analysis (processed and immediately discarded) Store → Analysis + transcript saved on your phone only No cloud storage. No audio files on servers. No training data. The only thing that touches the internet is the text transcript, and Gemini forgets it the moment the analysis completes. Everything else stays in your pocket, under your control. You can review past sessions, track patterns over time, or delete everything with one tap.

suniel-shetty,"Until just a few years ago, success, especially in startups, came with a certain template. Founders needed to sound global. Dress a certain way. Pitch a certain way. Sometimes maybe even think and operate in a way that wasn’t quite natural or authentic to them. I’ve seen that phase up close. And I understand where it came from. The entertainment business too had been a lot about recreating formulas that worked in the past. For a long time, we were trying to catch up. Trying to prove we belonged at the table. What I’m noticing now feels very different. Founders I meet today are far more comfortable being exactly who they are. They’re not trying to polish away their context.

And yet, what many of them are building has potential to travel far beyond our borders. This shift matters. Because that confidence changes everything.

stephaniehillsphd,"One path is grounded in fear the other grounded in faith… My first job out of grad school included leading a team of software engineers. I used to tell myself I was working hard, the team was working hard, but the truth? I was drifting, the team was drifting. We were busy, but we had no real direction. I let fear, doubt, and procrastination hold not just me, but the team, hostage. Then it hit me— successful people don’t wait for life to happen… they make life happen. They don’t let fear control their actions. They move with faith, clarity, and purpose. 🔥 So I made a choice. No more drifting. No more excuses. I got intentional, took action with vision and purpose, and built momentum. And that decision? It changed EVERYTHING. 📌 DRIFTER: A drifter is someone who accepts whatever life throws at them. They don’t know what they want, so they get exactly that— nothing. Fear dictates their actions. They hesitate, second-guess, and wait for the “perfect time” (which never comes). Drifters are controlled by circumstances instead of creating them. 🚀 SOMEONE WHO IS DRIVEN: Napoleon Hill defines a driven person as someone who possesses “ Definiteness of Purpose —a clear, unwavering vision for what they want and the relentless pursuit to make it happen”.

alexchriss,"Keep going, you are not alone. This is the message I wish I could personally deliver to every single one of the 30 million small business owners in the United States. Yes, we are in a time of unprecedented economic challenge for small business owners and self-employed individuals. But we are also in an extraordinary time of common purpose that can be summed up in four words: Help small businesses survive. Congress passed multiple rounds of legislation providing more than $650 billion in emergency aid for small businesses, self-employed, and other eligible organizations. The SBA implemented the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in record time. Banks and fintech lenders worked around the clock to serve the needs of the smallest of small businesses and self-employed individuals. The one thing I heard directly on video calls with our customers, is that it can be overwhelming to navigate the different aid programs and other options. Too many stories were about the challenge of getting relief to the people who need it most. Ricky Singh is the managing director for a company that sells permanent makeup and microblading merchandise to beauty salons, medspas and plastic surgeons. Once his clients began closing their doors, he says business at his company decreased by 60-75%. In mid-April, Ricky tried unsuccessfully to apply for PPP funding from two different banks. He was preparing payroll in QuickBooks when he saw that he could apply for a PPP loan from within the app itself. It took only a few minutes, and six days later, he received his funding. When he told his employees, there was a company-wide sigh of relief. He told us, “I think we’re gonna be good for a couple months going forward.” That sigh of relief is what every small business owner is searching for right now. And here’s the good news: It’s not too late to get the help you need. The SBA is still accepting PPP loan applications, and as of May 21st there is still more than $125 billion in available relief funds and more than 5500 SBA-approved lenders, including QuickBooks Capital. The SBA reported that since the start of PPP lending through May 22nd, the average PPP loan size has decreased from $239k to $116k. Loans for $50k or less make up more than 60% total approved loans in the second round of PPP funding, though they make up only 10% of total funds. The takeaway: smaller businesses are starting to get the PPP loans they need, but there’s still a ways to go. By comparison, the average loan size to date for our QuickBooks customers is around $35k. PPP relief is also available for self-employed individuals. A Gallup and QuickBooks Gig Economy and Self-Employment Report shows that in late 2019 there were 44 million self-employed professionals in the United States, many of whom are in need of the same PPP relief funds as other small businesses. Our self-employed customers can choose to use their 2019 TurboTax filings to validate their eligibility, allowing us to automate the application process and help size their loan. The average loan size for our QuickBooks self-employed customers is $7.5k. Even if you’ve been turned down for a loan in the past from a traditional lender, it’s worth applying for a PPP loan. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA and may be forgivable, in whole or in part, if certain requirements are met. The public policy intent behind the PPP is to quickly get relief dollars into the hands of small businesses so they can keep paying their employees. If you think you meet the basic eligibility requirements, it’s worth applying. And there’s one piece of advice that makes sense for every small business: The details matter more than ever. Small businesses are facing an existential crisis – every day brings new challenges and more hard decisions. In times like these, it can be tempting to push off the bookkeeping and compliance, especially for businesses with few employees. But in order to make the best decisions, small business owners must have a source of truth about where their business stands. Keeping the books up to date is especially critical when it comes to PPP loan forgiveness. We're working on product updates that can help automate much of the forgiveness process. But the best thing small business owners can do is to first learn , and then adhere , to PPP spending guidelines before it’s time to apply for loan forgiveness. Make sure that you’re meticulous when tracking the data, that it’s updated regularly and that you keep an organized file of original documents such as bills, receipts, and check copies. Making these types of spending decisions can be a lonely challenge, but I can’t say this enough: We’re here for you. How many times have you heard that small business is the backbone of the American economy? How many times have you actually seen that sentiment backed up by quick action? This is one of those rare times, and it is a defining moment for our country. Government, banks, and fintech lenders are all doing their best to help small businesses. Nothing is going to be perfect, and nothing is going to be easy. But in the end, and we have seen this time after time -- nothing beats the resilience of a small business owner and their employees.

dalianaliu,"Do you only use metrics like ‘mean’ or ‘ratio’ to make data-driven business decisions? If so, you are probably doing business analytics wrong. I’ll use two data analytics cases to show you why only focusing on those metrics can be dangerous, and what you should do instead. Case 1. The Average Value Can't Represent Your Customers Why? We use average a lot when analyzing product and business performance, but using average alone creates blind spots. Because there are always variations due to different segments of the market or pure randomness, and the average value doesn’t tell you the variation of stories. Example: How many products do our customers buy on average? A company is trying to understand the average amount of items purchased by a customer. For New York and LA, they found that the average of the items purchased per customer is the same (45 items). Now, based on the plot below, should we apply the same marketing strategy for the customers in New York and LA? NO. In LA (green line), 85% of customers purchased 40–50 items, which means the average amount(45) can represent most customer’s behavior. You might only need one big campaign to target the majority. However, in New York, the average value can only represent 50% of the customers’ behavior. The majority of customers, say 85%, lie between the buckets of purchasing 10 items to 80 items, which we can observe from the large ‘spread’ of data as shown by the orange ‘dumbbell’ shaped line. This means, the customers in New York have more variance than those in LA, and you probably need multiple campaign strategies for New York when the customers’ behaviors are more diversified. What Should We Do? Find out the range around the mean by calculating variance. Typically, data scientists report a Confidence Interval (CI) to estimate where the average lies in with a probability. (This link can help you construct a Confidence Interval, and you can create it within Excel) An example of reporting is: the mean of item purchased per customer in New York is 45, and the 85% Confidence Interval is between 10 to 80. Case 2. Ratio Metric Can Be Very Sensitive and Unreliable Why Ratio metric consists of at least two metrics; for example, Click-Through Rate is Clicks divided by Views. With each metric’s variation, the ratio metric’s variation is more complicated, and it doesn’t follow any common distribution. Example Let’s look at the table below first. You are measuring Click-Through Rate, from this table, it looks like Click-Through Rate increased from Jan to Feb. Sound great? Well, actually both Clicks and Views decreased, it’s just because the Views decreased more. So this increase is probably not what you want. Now, let’s look at the 4 more scenarios to see how Click-Through Rate changes when we control one variable and change the other. Can we trust the ratio with the same level of certainty in each scenario? The Left Table shows that, if the denominator (View) is stable, the ratio metric moves proportionally as the numerator (Click) moves, and the uncertainty of the data is easy to estimate, and the scale of uncertainty doesn’t change much. In the Right Table , when the denominator (View) is large enough as shown on the first few rows, ratio (CTR) is very stable with only 1–2% uncertainty. However, if you look at the bottom rows, the ratio can be very sensitive to changes and unstable when the denominator is small! When this is the case, it's better to monitor the Views and Clicks and expects a wide range of scenarios when you make decisions. What Should You Do? Set a threshold for minimal acceptable value for the denominator . As the ratio can have a great variance when the denominator is small, we only trust the ratio when the denominator is large enough. If you have to use the ratio metric to make decisions when the denominator is small, make sure you report a range that covers the fluctuation. Monitor the actual values (numerator, denominator) that we use for the ratio calculation. Understand the range of the ratio by simulating different scenarios of the numerator and denominator. Take-Aways For Your Business Analytics Strategy: Data analytics is not just calculation, it’s also the measurement of uncertainty. While summary statistics like mean or some ratio metrics help us ‘ Zoom Out ’ and see a big picture of data and our business, we also need to ‘ Zoom In ’ for the range and shape of data, to make sure we understand the uncertainty associated with the metrics. A data point is NOT enough! Create the range around it, and use variance to estimate uncertainty or different segmentations of the data. If your metric is ratio like Click-Through Rate, analyze different scenarios to see how the metric change as the denominator and numerator change. Be careful if your denominator is small, which means the ratio can be more sensitive to the change of data, and might not be reliable! Visualize it to make sure we don’t miss any pattern in the data or outliers. Share or Like this article if you find it helpful for other people!

richard-smith-7297565,"You probably don't need caching. Ok, maybe some of you do, but read on: caching is often premature optimisation, and it's hard to do well. I'm not doing the ""two hard things"" joke but it's not wrong in this instance. If you think you need to cache API responses because they take 5 seconds to return: take a look at why they are so slow, because there's probably something wrong there. If it's an intrinsically expensive dataset to evaluate and return, think about whether you need to request it at all, or if it can only be fetched on demand by a user actively pressing a button (which can turn into a 'refresh' button). If you think you need a distributed data cache protecting your database, are you *really* at the scale where that should be a problem? Or is your database bloated or inefficient in some other way (bad indices)? Or perhaps you are making queries against it which you shouldn't be. A central database server on reasonable hardware can handle very large numbers of queries if you use it well. And if you actually need a cache for REST API requests, maybe you can use the browser cache by setting Cache-Control and Expires headers, and using If-Modified-Since intelligently. As soon as you have a cache, you need to worry about - Updates and expiry - Showing users stale data (including potential data leakage of deleted content) - The performance of the cache - Cache miss behaviour - Deployment and upgrades of the cache and geographic synchronisation of its data, if it's distributed Now, of course, there are circumstances where you really do need a cache. That's why they were invented. We have caches, for example frequently rendered content is kept in a cache not your cloud storage, especially if we had to transcode it. But in my opinion it should be a solution for expensive calculated information or content, and only when you have a clear case for it.

alexchriss,"A quick glance at the latest headlines – self driving cars, cashier-less grocery stores – will leave no doubt that we have arrived in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). While big tech shifts have traditionally delivered disproportionate advantages to big companies who can afford the underlying infrastructure, I believe that the age of AI will play out differently. In this era, nimble, more adaptable small businesses are poised to reap advantages in equal, and often greater proportion to large companies – despite their deep pockets and data goldmines. Embracing automation To find out how small businesses are really adapting in the age of AI, my company, Intuit, recently partnered with Emergent Research to survey U.S.-based small business owners and managers about their attitudes toward automation technologies. We found that small businesses aren’t reeling or playing catch up to the global giants. Rather, they’re on the front lines in navigating this new era. Here are a few data points from the survey: · Sixty-six percent are already using some form of automation in their business, and overwhelmingly positive attitudes suggest that small businesses will continue to be bullish on adopting automation in the years ahead. · Fifty-four percent said they see automation as an opportunity, and despite the headlines and studies claiming automation’s “disruptive” impact on business and employment, only five percent said they see automation technology as a serious threat to their business. · One percent said they felt significant job reductions were imminent due to automation technology – dispelling the myth that small business owners are fearful of automation’s impact on “mom and pop” jobs. Plug-in tools and services have removed barriers to deploy AI, bringing the practical power of automation to even the smallest of businesses. Take, for example, Future Glory , a San Francisco-based maker of socially conscious handcrafted leather bags and accessories. Founder Theresa Lee relies on QuickBooks integrations with Shopify and PayPal to automate all transaction information into the financial management product to ensure accurate and real-time reporting, and give more time back to the design process. Lee spends less than 20 minutes a day on numbers, so she can focus on the heart of her business - creating unique leathercrafts. San Jose-based P3iD Cloud is a small business that is helping to level the playing field when it comes to automation. The company’s offering, P3iD Cloud QuickBooks Receipt , scans receipts, and then automatically extracts and classifies the receipts directly into QuickBooks. Founder Kevin Neal says this simple tool helps reduce or eliminate wasted labor costs associated with manual data entry of business travel receipts – typically saving employees two to three hours of time per trip. The survey revealed automation’s practical benefits to be the most valued by the small business owner: “freeing up time to get more work done” (79 percent) and “helping with customer service” (77 percent) were the top benefits mentioned. If you are one of the many small businesses looking to implement some form of automation technology this year, keep these three tips in mind: Consider the cloud. Moving your system from on-premise servers to cloud services like Google Apps, for example, is a necessary first step to embracing automation. Despite the positive attitudes, many small businesses are still not set up to take advantage of automation: almost 1 in 5 are not using the cloud. Doing so will set you on the right path toward automation, while also saving you money. Leverage intelligent platforms. Big data (24 percent), natural language processing (17 percent), and machine learning (12 percent) were ranked as the top categories of products in use in our survey. Fortunately, gaining access to these no longer requires a data warehouse, big budget, or a major infrastructure overhaul. Today, the most advanced automation technologies are easily accessible to small businesses via affordable third-party tools that plug a company’s data and workflow into AI and machine learning-powered platforms. Intelligent platforms like QuickBooks , for example, bring together more data than any one enterprise, meaning that the smallest business can now compete at scale around the world. Hone your niche. In a world filled with products like Siri, Alexa and Google Home, the niche products and services offered by small businesses will carry that much more weight in customer value. Allow automation to improve your business on the back-end, so you can focus on cultivating what has always made your small business unique on the front-end (like hyper-local apparel, or face-to-face customer service, for example). While we can’t predict every impact of automation on our economy, workforce and society, one thing is certain: small business owners will lead the charge in figuring out how to navigate and take advantage of this new reality.

alexchriss,"Every major technological leap has redefined commerce and payments. Now, we’re at the beginning of the next one: Agentic AI. How we got here For years, AI focused on prediction and reasoning. The 2010s saw a shift to deep learning, enabling breakthroughs in perception and language. ChatGPT later demonstrated the power of large language models (LLMs). But a central challenge remained: sophisticated AI models operated in isolation. This meant a customer researching restaurants with AI still had to switch to another app to book a table. Then earlier this year, innovations such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent protocol (A2A) arrived, giving AI agents the roadmaps to finally communicate, coordinate, and delegate tasks autonomously. With this, the foundation for the world of agentic commerce has been laid. Now the possibility of researching that restaurant and booking the reservation can happen together, and this is only the beginning. A new frontier in commerce In this emerging world of agentic commerce, AI agents can act on behalf of consumers or merchants without direct human involvement. We believe this shift to agentic commerce will drive the biggest transformations since the advent of e-commerce. It’s estimated that 25% of e-commerce spending will be driven by AI agents by 2030. Today, three fundamental shifts are underway: AI agents are the next-gen shopping assistant. Until now, personal shopping assistants have been reactive, taking orders and requests as they come. AI agents in the near future will be proactive, automating purchasing intelligently and safely behind the scenes. Commerce is being reimagined. For merchants, product data, inventory, and purchasing systems are extending past their digital storefronts, into the world of AI. Now, both large retailers and SMBs need to ensure their catalogs are discoverable and purchasable where their customers are: through AI chat apps, voice assistants, social media, mobile apps, and more. Customer journeys now begin and end in AI . Customers are increasingly making end-to-end decisions within AI services. They are now researching products, comparing prices, and making purchases in the flow of a conversation or inquiry. This means that for merchants who want insights into their customers, they must now factor in the AI layer as central domain in that journey, where brand touchpoints are increasingly delegated and mediated by AI. Together, this represents a massive opportunity and choice. The question isn't whether agentic commerce will reshape retail – it's whether your business will be leading the charge or scrambling to catch up. Retailers who act now to integrate with AI agents and meaningfully invest in agentic commerce will own the future. Those who wait will be left behind in a world where AI decides who wins. Realizing our vision for an agentic future PayPal is uniquely positioned to be the trustworthy, secure, and reliable enabler for agentic commerce, to help businesses and consumers unlock new value in the AI economy. We are doing this by building on our 25 years of responsible innovation and experience connecting hundreds of millions of consumers with tens of millions of merchants of our two-sided network, leading the transformation of commerce through AI-driven agentic experiences. And the team is already working at a rapid pace to make this happen. Right when MCP and A2A changed the industry earlier this year, PayPal released its Agent Toolkit and MCP servers , which now allow developers to create experiences that enable businesses to manage inventory, process payments, track shipments, manage subscriptions, issue refunds, and more, all powered by PayPal and within an AI agent. Since then, Anthropic , Microsoft , Salesforce , Windsurf , and others have incorporated PayPal’s MCP server as a part of their agentic tools for developers and businesses, and will make our full suite of commerce capabilities available to agentic developers, right inside the tools developers prefer. Building on this momentum, later this summer, Perplexity will bring PayPal into Perplexity Pro, to enable users to buy products or services directly in Perplexity's chat interface. PayPal and Venmo are built for this next wave of AI-powered commerce. Hundreds of millions of consumers trust our platforms for secure, personalized payments and rewards. And this trust will be critical as consumers shift to discovery and purchasing with agents. Agent experiences work best when they know enough about the user to recommend the right product and deliver a frictionless checkout — exactly the kind of context PayPal uniquely understands and protects. Glimpses: A parent and a business, powered by agents Imagine Sarah, a working mother of three who dreads Sunday nights—not because Monday is coming, but because she hasn't planned the week's meals yet. Between soccer practice, client calls, and helping with homework, meal planning often falls through the cracks, so Sarah is faced with making another late-night grocery run or ordering takeout yet again. Now imagine Sarah simply telling her AI agent between client calls: ""Plan healthy meals for next week based on the meals we’ve made in the past, accommodate Jake's peanut allergy, and keep grocery costs under $150."" An agent then instantly creates a meal plan, and schedules delivery for Tuesday when Sarah is working from home. Now consider Marcus, who runs a small print shop. It's Thursday afternoon, and his main heat press just broke during a rush order for a local business event happening on the weekend. In today’s world, Marcus faces a difficult choice: spend hours calling suppliers, comparing prices, and arranging expedited shipping—losing an entire day of production—or disappoint his client and risk losing the sale. Enter agentic commerce. Marcus tells his AI agent: ""My heat press model PY-2025 is broken. I need a replacement that arrives by Friday, my budget is $3,000 max."" The agent immediately begins coordinating across suppliers, checking inventory, negotiating expedited shipping, and processing the order through PayPal—all while Marcus continues fulfilling other orders. Bringing agentic commerce to life, together This transformation — from reactive transacting to proactive assistance — represents the core of agentic commerce. For overwhelmed parents like Sarah, AI agents can proactively eliminate the mental load of coordination. For small business owners like Marcus who can't afford operational interruptions but desperately need solutions, AI agents can be the “save” that helps keep their businesses running. Critically in both scenarios, Sarah and Marcus’ thought to turn to AI agents would not have been possible without trust – trust and confidence in their AI agents to make the order accurately, safely, and securely. And it wouldn’t have been possible if it weren’t for trusted the merchants who made the sales to Sarah and Marcus’ AI agents. This future is exactly what we are inspired to build at PayPal — an agentic future that delivers value for consumers and merchants, built on safety and trust. I am excited by the momentum we are creating, together with the biggest names in AI, to help usher in agentic commerce.

brianevergreen,"Most leaders are still trying to solve problems. That used to work. But in an environment shaped by accelerating technology, AI, cultural and social complexity, and constant disruption, the biggest risk isn’t unsolved problems—it’s solving the wrong problems extremely well. When I was at Microsoft leading AI strategy for the US, I noticed something consistent: Teams got better and better at optimization while the future moved somewhere else. More data. Better dashboards. Faster execution. And still, strategy stumbled. Growth categories missed. What should have been achievable was impossible. Because problem solving assumes the future is an extension of the past, and it starts with what’s wrong. Future solving starts somewhere different. Instead of asking: “How do we fix or get rid of what’s broken?” It asks: “What kind of future are we actually trying to create, and what would make that inevitable?” That shift changes everything (and it’s why I started The Future Solving Company ).

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"During his May Day speech a few days ago, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that we need to think long term, work towards it with patience and determination, and build lasting strengths for Singapore and ourselves, beyond our own generation. A big part of building such capabilities involves capitalising on emerging technologies like #AI which is already proving to bring remarkable long-term changes in the way we live, work and play. Thanks to #ChatGPT and similar models, AI is taking centrestage both in our personal and work life. However, what many don’t realise is that high-speed connectivity is the backbone driving AI. Super-fast #5G networks of today make it possible to exploit AI-based environments which enable automation and flexible processes that result in the hyper efficiency required to thrive in the new digital economy. Every industry sector, be it manufacturing, healthcare, education, logistics, public utilities, and government service delivery, benefits from having secure and ultra-high bandwidth of 5G. Singtel’s modern networks can provide download speeds of up to 10 Gbps per second and upload capability of up to 1 Gbps. That means you can download a 4K movie in less than 30 seconds or stream around 1,700 movies simultaneously. That’s great for consumers and even better for businesses that need to process large volumes of such content. Imagine the efficiency and productivity this offers! The latest 5G standard also supports a 10-fold increase in network capacity that can translate to as many as 100 billion #IoT connections. It also offers a latency of around 5 milliseconds, much lower than the 8-12 milliseconds of first-generation 5G networks. With this kind of low latency and capacity, businesses can do so much more with IoT that are increasingly relevant for modern workloads - especially in Industry 4.0 applications. And on the home front, we now have 10Gbps broadband that opens up possibilities for everyone! Some examples of applications today include Micron who’ve deployed a 5G millimetre wave (mmWave) solution, which provides an assured bandwidth of up to 2Gbps with ultra-low latency for AI driven image-based quality control at their 3D NAND flash memory fabrication plant in Singapore. Singtel’s Multi-access Edge Computing solutions have also been deployed at the #HyundaiMotorGroupInnovationCentre in Singapore to boost the operational efficiency of the factory. Beyond the manufacturing sector, the @NationalUniversityHealthSystem has been applying #MEC-based holomedicine technology for surgeons, in collaboration with @Microsoft. This allows surgeons to visualise a patient’s internal organs in 3D by using mixed reality and helps them to plan surgeries better, find veins to draw blood accurately, and more. While these examples may give the impression that 5G and its associated benefits are only for large enterprises, that’s not the case. As a homegrown company which has been a partner in the nation’s development for decades, we are always invested in the success of Singapore, which includes both consumers as well as businesses of all sizes. Which is why we’re aware that adopting advanced technologies like 5G and its related technologies can be daunting - especially for the over 95% of companies in Singapore that are SMEs. That is why we’ve developed platforms like Paragon and CUBΣ to make access and adoption of our best-in-class mobile network and digital solutions easy. They help businesses easily select and seamlessly deploy solutions like network, edge computing to cloud and more with just a few clicks. And help is also available if required. We understand that change can be difficult. But as leaders, we have had tough choices to make over the years when adopting modern technologies like cloud computing, software-as-a-service and others that have transformed Singapore into a global tech powerhouse that is anchored on the pillars of innovation, business networks and robust tech infrastructure. In today’s landscape we do not have the option to think, “There’s no rush, I can still get to this in a few years… I don’t have the budget or technical resources to implement this.” In today’s digital economy, tech is imperative to business success and resistance to adoption can be detrimental. In this respect, as our PM underscored, we should not think that adopting AI is a leap of faith but look at it as a step in the right direction that will empower every worker. We have lowered the barriers of entry for AI-driven innovation and encourage all to join this revolution. We are here to help.

some examples of applications today include micron whove deployed a 5g millimetre wave mmwave solution, which provides an assured bandwidth of up to 2gbps with ultra-low latency for ai driven image-based quality control at their 3d nand flash memory fabrication plant in singapore. singtels multi-access edge computing solutions have also been deployed at the #hyundaimotorgroupinnovationcentre in singapore to boost the operational efficiency of the factory. beyond the manufacturing sector, the mention#mec-based holomedicine technology for surgeons, in collaboration with mention. this allows surgeons to visualise a patients internal organs in 3d by using mixed reality and helps them to plan surgeries better, find veins to draw blood accurately, and more. while these examples may give the impression that 5g and its associated benefits are only for large enterprises, thats not the case. as a homegrown company which has been a partner in the nations development for decades, we are always invested in the success of singapore, which includes both consumers as well as businesses of all sizes. which is why were aware that adopting advanced technologies like 5g and its related technologies can be daunting - especially for the over 95 of companies in singapore that are smes. that is why weve developed platforms like paragon and cub to make access and adoption of our best-in-class mobile network and digital solutions easy. they help businesses easily select and seamlessly deploy solutions like network, edge computing to cloud and more with just a few clicks. and help is also available if required. we understand that change can be difficult. but as leaders, we have had tough choices to make over the years when adopting modern technologies like cloud computing, software-as-a-service and others that have transformed singapore into a global tech powerhouse that is anchored on the pillars of innovation, business networks and robust tech infrastructure. in todays landscape we do not have the option to think, theres no rush, i can still get to this in a few years i dont have the budget or technical resources to implement this. in todays digital economy, tech is imperative to business success and resistance to adoption can be detrimental. in this respect, as our pm underscored, we should not think that adopting ai is a leap of faith but look at it as a step in the right direction that will empower every worker. we have lowered the barriers of entry for ai-driven innovation and encourage all to join this revolution. we are here to help. lets build the future together. #singtel5g #empowereverygeneration #hellopossibilities",-15,too_long,"during his may day speech a few days ago, prime minister lee hsien loong said that we need to think long term, work towards it with patience and determination, and build lasting strengths for singapore and ourselves, beyond our own generation",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,5,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,2,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,64,64

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"At HP, our goal for the coming year is to prepare ourselves, our partners and our customers to be future-ready. That means being primed for change, ready to act on opportunity and trained to execute with efficiency. This ideal state of readiness requires us to have clarity in vision. For business leaders, the perennial challenge is to look ahead without being clouded by the fog of uncertainty. One thing that has become clear to me in the last two years is that increasingly we must find our own path to succeeding and thriving in this evolving hybrid world. To drive clarity from uncertainty requires us to act with more self-leadership and intentionality. This involves challenging past sacred cows, playing the long-game and being adept at operating at the edge of discomfort. Principles that I’ve mentioned before but worth stressing again. Only by being comfortable with change can we act with more confidence, clarity and certainty. One theme that has never been more clear is the fundamental role of technology in our growth as businesses and as individuals. Research firm IDC stated recently that: “higher digital technology spending establishes a foundation for resilient digital businesses to react with agility to storms and disruptions.” IDC’s latest tech predictions for 2023 project spending on digital technology by Asia/Pacific organizations will grow 3.5x the economy in 2023. I see three major digital trends shaping the way we lead and the way we work in the coming year and beyond: Tech Trend 1 – The rise of “Phygital” If we take a simple meeting, there is a large difference between meeting online and offline. Let me give a personal example of how this has affected my leadership. Prior to the pandemic, when I travelled a lot more, much of my work would be done before or around the meeting. I’d find areas of agreement, use moments to persuade, so that when I entered the meeting, I was fairly confident my point would be addressed. In online meetings today being laser-focused is critical. The strongest argument is the one that usually prevails so we need to be clearer and more structured when meeting online as compared to offline. We’re now seeing the rise of Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality as well as advances in remote working technology that bridge the gap and create a truly phygital reality. Early examples include the medical field, where operations can be conducted remotely. At HP we use Virtual Reality to train our engineers. This will move more and more into business, especially in the areas of communication and collaboration. As leaders and employees, we need to be looking at technologies and ways we can bridge the gap to enhance the human experience felt in a digital world. I expect the phygital trend to increasingly impact the way we engage and interact across more and more aspects of our lives. Technology Trend 2 – Data driven applications and services The moment you finish the latest Netflix series, you’re immediately prompted by “because you watched” suggestions for your next potential viewing. Data-driven applications, services and inevitably data-driven decision making will become a seamless way of life. Take payroll processing companies, who use their data to help their clients with strategic workforce planning, so they can anticipate the skills they will need in the future, and then take proactive steps to recruit, train, and retain the required workers. As leaders we face daily decisions, sometimes large, sometimes small. Each of those decisions will have a cascading effect. By using data driven applications and services those decisions can be eased. This is especially pertinent when it comes to DE&I. We all have unconscious biases based on our experience. It means that while it’s clear more diverse boards perform better, a majority of FORTUNE 500 boards are still dominated by men. We recently launched our channel partner program – HP Amplify. Within this broad program aimed at merging information between ourselves and our partners, is a large data analytics operation that sifts through purchasing behaviour to help our partners predict when to engage with customers. For example, past purchasing behaviour based on the life cycle of equipment can help our partners reach out and engage with customers proactively. Another is our Instant Ink program, a subscription model that not only means your ink is delivered before you run out, it’s also sustainable in terms of meaning you don’t have to drive out to buy it. Expect to see applications that monitor your workflow, creating efficiencies in how you manage your days activities, or even tell you to take a rest based on biometrics. Technology 3 - The 4th Industrial Revolution Every industrial revolution comes with great change in the workforce. The coming of 4IR, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, connected devices and systems will be no different. We know we need new workforce skills for jobs that are still being defined or not yet even created yet. This will involve strong collaboration between government, institutions and business to ensure our emerging new workforce is equipped with not just skills, but the mindset to operate at the edge of discomfort. Change also brings opportunity. In combination with the first two trends I covered, it will allow us to focus on higher value, more creative and impactful work. Such technologies can also help with the pressing concern for the planet. For example, at our Printhead manufacturing plant here in Singapore, we explore the creation and improvement of parts in our factory using 3D, or additive, manufacturing. This means we use less materials and parts to create a replacement part, but also save on transport and storage given we can print on-demand. The 4th Industrial Revolution needs to go hand-in-hand with building a more sustainable future. Throughout these three trends, there is opportunity to deliver a more seamless and engaging work experience, more efficient decision making, plus a little more certainty in the path we’re taking to move forward.",206.0,3.0,1156,,30044,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],6077,6057,990,987,51,0,0,0,"at hp, our goal for the coming year is to prepare ourselves, our partners and our customers to be future-ready. that means being primed for change, ready to act on opportunity and trained to execute with efficiency. this ideal state of readiness requires us to have clarity in vision. for business leaders, the perennial challenge is to look ahead without being clouded by the fog of uncertainty. one thing that has become clear to me in the last two years is that increasingly we must find our own path to succeeding and thriving in this evolving hybrid world. to drive clarity from uncertainty requires us to act with more self-leadership and intentionality. this involves challenging past sacred cows, playing the long-game and being adept at operating at the edge of discomfort. principles that ive mentioned before but worth stressing again. only by being comfortable with change can we act with more confidence, clarity and certainty. one theme that has never been more clear is the fundamental role of technology in our growth as businesses and as individuals. research firm idc stated recently that: higher digital technology spending establishes a foundation for resilient digital businesses to react with agility to storms and disruptions. idcs latest tech predictions for 2023 project spending on digital technology by asiapacific organizations will grow 3.5x the economy in 2023. i see three major digital trends shaping the way we lead and the way we work in the coming year and beyond: tech trend 1  the rise of phygital if we take a simple meeting, there is a large difference between meeting online and offline. let me give a personal example of how this has affected my leadership. prior to the pandemic, when i travelled a lot more, much of my work would be done before or around the meeting. id find areas of agreement, use moments to persuade, so that when i entered the meeting, i was fairly confident my point would be addressed. in online meetings today being laser-focused is critical. the strongest argument is the one that usually prevails so we need to be clearer and more structured when meeting online as compared to offline. were now seeing the rise of virtual reality and augmented reality as well as advances in remote working technology that bridge the gap and create a truly phygital reality. early examples include the medical field, where operations can be conducted remotely. at hp we use virtual reality to train our engineers. this will move more and more into business, especially in the areas of communication and collaboration. as leaders and employees, we need to be looking at technologies and ways we can bridge the gap to enhance the human experience felt in a digital world. i expect the phygital trend to increasingly impact the way we engage and interact across more and more aspects of our lives. technology trend 2  data driven applications and services the moment you finish the latest netflix series, youre immediately prompted by because you watched suggestions for your next potential viewing. data-driven applications, services and inevitably data-driven decision making will become a seamless way of life. take payroll processing companies, who use their data to help their clients with strategic workforce planning, so they can anticipate the skills they will need in the future, and then take proactive steps to recruit, train, and retain the required workers. as leaders we face daily decisions, sometimes large, sometimes small. each of those decisions will have a cascading effect. by using data driven applications and services those decisions can be eased. this is especially pertinent when it comes to dei. we all have unconscious biases based on our experience. it means that while its clear more diverse boards perform better, a majority of fortune 500 boards are still dominated by men. we recently launched our channel partner program  hp amplify. within this broad program aimed at merging information between ourselves and our partners, is a large data analytics operation that sifts through purchasing behaviour to help our partners predict when to engage with customers. for example, past purchasing behaviour based on the life cycle of equipment can help our partners reach out and engage with customers proactively. another is our instant ink program, a subscription model that not only means your ink is delivered before you run out, its also sustainable in terms of meaning you dont have to drive out to buy it. expect to see applications that monitor your workflow, creating efficiencies in how you manage your days activities, or even tell you to take a rest based on biometrics. technology 3 -

suniel-shetty,"There’s a part of leadership people don’t talk about much. Not the pressure. Not the long hours. The quiet that comes with responsibility. With experience, or as your role grows, you start noticing a shift. When decisions get tougher and the stakes are higher, people start to look to you for direction. Earlier in my career, I felt the need to fill every silence. Explain my thinking. Give clarity and direction quickly. With time, that urge fades. Not because you can’t operate swiftly anymore, but because you start understanding the weight your words carry. When you speak too soon, sometimes it creates noise. When you think aloud without clarity, it can leave people unsure. So then you learn to sit with a decision first. You do the messy thinking quietly. You test things in your own head before bringing them to the team. That’s not about operating on your own. That’s just responsibility. I’ve learned that not every thought or idea needs a group discussion. Sometimes thinking by yourself does more for a situation than more discussions. This shows up everywhere. In teams. In the creative process of filmmaking. In families. In any situation where others are watching how you respond. You realise that being present or bringing your experience to the table doesn’t always mean being vocal. That quiet isn’t dramatic or heavy. It’s just the space you give yourself to think clearly before others depend on what you say. And when you finally speak, it’s not to be heard.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"As I reflect on 2023, I’m filled with gratitude. It’s been a year of big changes for me. I welcomed my first grandchild (Oliver), changed job for the first time in 33 years and on the homefront, our beloved Australian Shepard (Nalla) gave birth to 5 puppies! It has been indeed an eventful and fruitful year for me. I needed to get used to being a grandad, as well as a new work environment. The grandad bit is incredibility rewarding and fun filled. The experience is easier to manage but navigating the telco space took some work. I’m extremely appreciative of the warmth Singtel has shown me as I got to know the business and colleagues. Am amazed by how the organisation is fueled by its purpose to empower people and businesses, and help close digital divides. Singtel has a longstanding history with a clear north star to use technology to improve lives – continuously adapting to the times and preparing for the future needs of Singapore. Brand, History, & People When I first came to Singtel, I was surprised to meet employees who’d spent three or even four decades here. Many of our employees have such an affinity to the brand and I quickly discovered why. Singtel has kept Singapore connected for more than a century, evolving from operator-assisted calls to pagers to 5G today. Our employees appreciate the impact they’re making every day in the lives of millions. As one of Singtel’s newest employees, I’m proud to be part of this team as we continue to pave new ground for innovation. Breaking New Frontiers with Technology 2023 was filled with network advancements – in particular, around 5G. Singapore became the first country in the world to deploy 5G standalone nationwide, turning us into the ideal testbed for 5G applications. We’ve conducted more than 30 5G trials from healthcare to smart manufacturing and aviation with organisations like National University Health System , DSTA , HTX (Home Team Science & Technology Agency) , the Changi Airport Group – pushing the boundaries of the new technology. One such area is network slicing. If you think of 5G as a highway, network slicing is like having a VIP lane for the customer, with added bandwidth and boosted connectivity – perfect for specific uses like HD video, industrial sensors, augmented reality, and gaming that require fast, stable and lag-free connectivity. We’ve successfully tested this at high-profile events like the National Day parade and F1, that typically may cause network congestion due to the sheer volume of users performing high data consuming activities. But I thought the coolest activation was the livestreaming of a rock concert from an underground MRT cabin – another first in Singapore! Empowering Communities In an increasingly digital society, the vulnerable often get left behind. We want them, namely the elderly, to enjoy the benefits of a digital lifestyle so they can feel a sense of belonging and be engaged in society. This requires ensuring they have the tools and confidence to use technology. We worked across multiple fronts to ensure they have everything they need to be plugged into a digital economy: 1) We worked with 3,000 seniors via the Singtel Digital Silvers programme over the past 18 months, teaching seniors how to go online safely and use indispensable apps like Singpass. 2) About 36,000 of our GOMO customers have also donated 1 million GB of unused data to nearly 6,000 seniors since early last year. 3) With our partner, Engineering Good, we refurbished about 957kg of electronic devices that came through our device donation programme for low-income families and the elderly. But sometimes, it’s not about technology. It’s about being seen and included. For the first time, I had the privilege of being part of a day of rides and games for over 2,000 special needs students – specially set up for them to develop interpersonal skills and build self-confidence while having fun. It was hosted by over 2,000 volunteers from Singtel and 300 more from our partners. The joy on the students’ faces and the energy they brought to the event was one of the biggest highlights of my year. Forging Ahead As we wind down for the year, I’m reminded of the words of former Head of Civil Service, Mr. Lim Siong Guan, on how to be a good leader. We need to do it “with a strong heart, strong head and strong hands”. I hold these words dear – to be kind, compassionate and steadfast – at home and at work.

alexchriss,"In today’s often volatile climate, philanthropy remains a top priority for small business owners. Natural disasters ranging from Hurricane Harvey to the California wildfires have made charity a topic that is all too real for business owners looking for ways to show their support. Moreover, the majority of today’s customers care deeply about social causes , encouraging many business owners to seek ways of incorporating giving into their business models. So how can your small business make a big impact with a limited budget? Here are a few ways to get started. Identify and focus on what is personally meaningful Giving for the sake of giving is of limited value. When you contribute to a cause you truly care about, giving becomes more meaningful, more impactful, not to mention easier for the business. Identify which philanthropic causes matter to you and your business. Make a short list of your priorities and rank them, then match a charity or effort to each one. You might be surprised how effortless it feels to execute on your plan when it’s related to something you’re passionate about. The idea for Homefree , a cookie business catering to customers with special dietary needs (nut-free, vegan, and gluten-free) grew from a place of personal meaning for founder Jill Robbins. As a clinical psychologist and a mother to a child with food allergies, Robbins knew the importance of inclusion and its positive impact on those with special dietary needs. Homefree’s commitment to inclusion is evident in all of their contributions, from food donations for disaster relief efforts, to allergy support group talks and more. Says Robbins, “Focus on what is personally meaningful, and the passion, energy, and commitment will easily follow.” Don’t reinvent the wheel One of the simplest ways for a small business to give back is to partner with local non-profits that are already doing good work, and support the causes you care about. Partnerships can take many forms and are often quite flexible. It could include being a sponsor for a fundraiser, working as a volunteer at an event, or donating a portion of sales to the non-profit. ReVision Energy is a renewable energy contracting company whose socially-focused roots run deep. Even when ReVision was small and their ability to give was less, the company would partner with Habitat for Humanity and other non-profit organizations to provide aid in lieu of cash donations. Says digital marketing manager Fred Greenhalgh, “If you can support someone else's mission, you will likely make more of an impact than trying to reinvent the wheel.” Offer in-kind donations instead of cash An excellent giving option for cash-limited small businesses are in-kind donations, providing goods or some service as a contribution instead of money. The form of these donations depends on your business. In-kind donations might be muffins that your bakery makes, a price break on copies from your print shop, or free space in your office that a charity can use for meetings – or even simply volunteering your time. Leah's Pantry provides cooking and nutrition workshops to underserved populations throughout California. Founder Adrienne Markworth says in-kind donations are central to the business, which offers training to local agencies on how to encourage good nutrition among low-income families and providing workshops on the topic for the community. Says Markworth, “We know that everyone deserves nourishment, but the barriers are complex and varied. We believe our focus of presenting individual and community-led solutions [as opposed to cash] is the most impactful and sustainable for the health of our communities.” Start making an impact now In today’s socially-conscious climate, giving back shouldn’t be an afterthought. It should be baked into your small business’s DNA. Fortunately, you don’t need a mountain of cash to make a big impact in your local community. Focusing your cause, finding the right partners, and offering in-kind donations are just a few ways you can get involved. Start by thinking about the “why” of your business – why you do what you do – as well as what is important to you and your customers. The areas where you can make a big impact in your community will quickly become evident.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"Dear Nastassia and Pearl, Sitting, waiting, nervous, the canvas of my career stretched out before me. I remember my first interview. Now I look back and see you both at a similar stage in your lives. You’re standing at the start of your own unique career paths. A relationship between fathers and daughters is special (don’t tell your brothers) and this is an important moment in your lives. It seems especially pertinent to me given we’re in International Women’s Month and the world is changing for the better. If you’ll indulge your dad, looking at two strong, confident women I’d like to think I have some responsibility for, I want to share some reflections. When I think about it, I come down to two key thoughts. Understanding your Why? The first is to answer - what is my why? When I chose to join the Reserve Army (National Service) in Singapore there was a point when responsibility weighed heavily on me, I had more than 1000 people under my care. I also had a family and a responsibility-filled job as a senior executive. I asked myself why I was doing this? The answer is that I believe that my family and I have benefited a lot from the peace and security that we enjoy in Singapore. So, my ‘why’ was to play my part, to help ensure Singapore remains safe and to not take our peaceful situation for granted. Answering this why gave me the direction to guide the decisions I faced. Before I joined HP in my 20s, I had a choice between joining a large bank or coming here. I had interned in both companies. For me the decision went beyond salary and perks. I also asked myself why, why this company? My answer was, and remains, that HP is truly centered on its people. We believe in the HP Way. We see people with names not titles. I have led businesses and teams at HP with confidence and pride because I feel very positive about our culture and enjoy working & growing within this HP ecosystem. Ask yourself why you’re doing what you’re doing because if you’re comfortable with the why, then the how becomes much easier. Understanding your Choices My second thought is to believe in yourself and your choices. You will be faced with many choices, and that’s a good thing. Your career path is not linear, nor should it be. There have been times in my career where I was faced with moving up the management chain or moving to a new responsibility, an opportunity to learn. There is as much benefit to moving to something new in terms of rounding out your skills as there is to move up the chain. In fact, it better prepares you for that eventual move. Our leadership programs often involve moving people around the business to create a solid leadership pipeline for the future. So be open minded in your choices rather than think you always need to move in one direction. I trust your choices. Of course, there are challenges, doors will be closed. You will face difficult interviews, people might question your career, opportunities can be lost. You may be disappointed but once it’s past then seek the door that’s opened, which brings me to the topic of confidence. Knowing your ‘why’ gives you confidence, knowing you have choices gives you confidence. Yet there are other forms of confidence. For example, the confidence to speak up. I do notice that people can be reticent in meetings, or afraid to ask questions, or ask for what they want. Perhaps someone has noticed inappropriate behavior but are afraid of calling it out. The confidence to speak your thoughts is important, as a leader part of my job is to create a working environment where people feel enabled if not encouraged to speak up. You always have the right to speak. This confidence to ask, to challenge, to explore will greatly benefit you in your career and life. Root that confidence in yourself but also know that I will always have your back. Taking your Time Finally, allow time for play. To play is to explore your creativity, to take a little time to yourself and it’s very important you take a break now and then. As you know I’ve taken up LEGO. It gives me a sense of accomplishment outside of my career where I can clear my mind and then return to work with focus.

strickvl,"I've been digging through infrastructure talks and case studies trying to answer a simple question: How are companies scheduling GPU resources for long-running AI agents? Not training jobs. Agents. The kind that hold a GPU for 10 minutes while reasoning through a complex task. Or spin up hundreds of instances in parallel to fix a thousand lint violations.

suniel-shetty,"Over the last year or so, I’ve noticed a shift in the way founders talk. Earlier, the conversations were about mega scale, speed and what’s coming next. Big visions. Quick timelines. Now, the tone feels different. Calmer. Sharper. Founders are speaking less about how fast they’ll grow, and more about how long they can last. Less about headlines, more about fundamentals. Cash flows. Customers. Teams. Culture. To some it might sound like ambition has softened. I don’t think that’s true at all. What’s really happened is that pressure has done its job. A tougher environment has forced people to look closely at their businesses. To cut noise. To focus on what actually works. To own decisions instead of chasing momentum. And that is great thing. Because the avg Indian founder has always known how to build with constraints. With our middle class upbringing we’ve grown up learning how to stretch a rupee, make do, and still deliver.

reidhoffman,"Tanay is ushering in a world where voice becomes the primary interface with technology. Here’s the idea he returns to, again and again: the keyboard was never meant to be a long-term solution. As he reminded me, there are 700 million people with dyslexia for whom “using technology means spelling words with a keyboard—the literal hardest thing for them to do.” Millions more with Parkinson’s, ALS, or motor challenges find typing impossible. Older adults peck at keys with two fingers. Even fast typists are contorting their minds into an outdated input device. People assume switching to voice is about speed, but voice interfaces are much more than time savers. Typing itself forces the mind into a choppy, self-editing posture. Every sentence becomes a series of micro-interruptions: spell this, fix that, move this clause, check that comma. By contrast, speaking lets the idea come out whole. “Just tell me your gibberish,” he said, “and I’ll take care of it.” The power of what he’s built with Wispr Flow is that, within half a second, your ramble becomes polished prose, and the median user hits send without even rereading. The trust is immediate. And the behavioral effects are fascinating: sales teams sound more human, customer service agents sound warmer, “bad texters” suddenly become articulate communicators. The most intriguing point Tanay made is that voice will force us to rethink hardware itself. Our devices today were built for screens, keyboards, and apps. They assume computing is something you sit down to do, staring into a rectangle. But an AI-native world could leverage ambient listening, lightweight cognition, continuous context, and interaction that feels like talking to a second brain. If that’s true, then voice is the opening act of a much larger shift away from screen-bound computing toward a world where technology blends into the background and our attention returns to the foreground. A world where we walk through cities with our eyes up, not down. A world where AI augments cognition rather than fragments it. Tanay’s vision is radical only because we’ve lived inside the keyboard era for so long. His out-of-the-box thinking is allowing us to finally work beyond the box itself—the screen that mediates every digital interaction most of us have ever had. But once you see what’s possible, it feels less like science fiction and more like overdue course correction.

niharika-gupta-8bb47882,"I spent the week at AWS re:Invent, and the noise was loud. But for an engineer paying attention, the signal was clear. We are moving past the era of ""Chatbots"" and into the era of Agentic Workflows . As a Senior Engineer, I wasn't just looking for new tools; I was looking for patterns that scale in production. Here is my day-by-day breakdown of the critical architectural shifts I observed. Day 1: The Death of the ""Do-It-All"" Prompt Day 1 set the tone immediately. The prevailing message from the industry tracks was that single-prompt architectures are dead. If you want reliability, you need specialization. The ""Switch Statement"" Rule (Session IND357) In a deep dive on multi-agent collaboration for optimized advertising performance, I saw a design principle: ""If you can write a switch statement for it, don't use agent reasoning."" We often try to force LLMs to do everything. But blending deterministic logic (code) with probabilistic logic (AI) is the only way to keep costs down. Save the ""reasoning"" for actual judgment calls. Media Ops: The Coordinator Pattern (Session IND309) I explored a ""Media Lake"" architecture that solves the context window problem. Instead of one giant model, a Coordinator Agent (built with Strands) routes tasks to specialized sub-agents (Rights Agent, Video Search Agent). Key Concept: Proactive vs. Reactive. The agent doesn't just search; it finds the video, checks rights, and reformats it automatically. Serverlesspresso: Choreography vs. Orchestration (Session API309-R) A hands-on workshop reinforced that scalable apps require decoupling. We used AWS Step Functions to orchestrate the specific order workflow (the ""recipe"") and Amazon EventBridge to choreograph the communication between microservices (Order Manager vs. Publisher). Day 2: The New Standard for Integration If Day 1 was about logic, Day 2 was about plumbing. How do we actually connect these agents to our tools without writing endless glue code? The Keynote: Reinventing Foundations (Session KEY001) Matt Garman on how AWS is innovating across every aspect of the world’s leading cloud. The ""USB-C"" of AI (Session IND311) The acronym of the week is MCP (Model Context Protocol) . Instead of hard-coding API wrappers, we can build MCP Servers that expose our internal tools (pricing, video encoders, databases) to any agent. This moves us from ""Infrastructure as Code"" to ""Infrastructure as Intent."" Privacy as Production (Session IND360) I also looked at how AdTech is handling privacy. The takeaway: Synthetic Data is no longer just for research. Using AWS Clean Rooms to generate synthetic datasets that maintain statistical properties is now a production-ready strategy for collaboration. Day 3: Video AI & The 5K I started the day with the annual re:Invent 5K (finished in 35:59! 🏃♂️), but the technical highlight was seeing how Amazon Nova changes video pipelines. Compliance without the CV Pipeline (Session IND397) We used to build complex, frame-by-frame computer vision pipelines to check if a video was ""safe"" or ""on-brand. The new pattern is radically simpler: Use Amazon Nova ’s 1M token context window to simply ""watch"" the whole video. You can replace thousands of lines of CV code with a few robust prompts like ""Is the price tag visible at 0:05?"" Day 4: Composition Over Generation This was the most strategic day for my work in Creative Tech. We tackled the ""Hallucination Problem"" in marketing assets. Decomposition Pipelines (Session AIM373) You can't prompt your way to a perfect, on-brand image. The successful pattern I saw is Composition . Successful architectures don't just ask for an image. They: Retrieve the specific product asset. Define the layout and physics programmatically. Render the pixels only after the constraints are set. Day 5: The Human Strategy My final day focused on Developer Tools, specifically a session with HashiCorp and AWS on ""Kiro""—their AI-powered dev tool (DVT216). They showed how Kiro accelerated Terraform Provider development by 90% , but the most important slide wasn't about speed. It was about the ""Organic Transformation"" of the engineer's role. The slide put it perfectly: ""AI Agents can create and achieve great things. But it's the human who provides the contextual and tooling wisdom—the strategy—that prevents Agents from assuming in the dark."" Final Thoughts The future doesn't belong to the engineer who can write the most syntax. It belongs to the engineer who can orchestrate these powerful new agents with wisdom, strategy, and ""Contextual Control."" #AWSreInvent #CloudArchitecture #GenerativeAI #Engineering",46.0,2.0,59,,2454,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],3,3,"['🏃', '♂', '️']",4,"['#AWSreInvent', '#CloudArchitecture', '#GenerativeAI', '#Engineering']",4596,4550,718,717,51,2,1,0,"i spent the week at aws re:invent, and the noise was loud. but for an engineer paying attention, the signal was clear. we are moving past the era of ""chatbots"" and into the era of agentic workflows . as a senior engineer, i wasn't just looking for new tools; i was looking for patterns that scale in production. here is my day-by-day breakdown of the critical architectural shifts i observed. day 1: the death of the ""do-it-all"" prompt day 1 set the tone immediately. the prevailing message from the industry tracks was that single-prompt architectures are dead. if you want reliability, you need specialization. the ""switch statement"" rule session ind357 in a deep dive on multi-agent collaboration for optimized advertising performance, i saw a design principle: ""if you can write a switch statement for it, don't use agent reasoning."" we often try to force llms to do everything. but blending deterministic logic code with probabilistic logic ai is the only way to keep costs down. save the ""reasoning"" for actual judgment calls. media ops: the coordinator pattern session ind309 i explored a ""media lake"" architecture that solves the context window problem. instead of one giant model, a coordinator agent built with strands routes tasks to specialized sub-agents rights agent, video search agent. key concept: proactive vs. reactive. the agent doesn't just search; it finds the video, checks rights, and reformats it automatically. serverlesspresso: choreography vs. orchestration session api309-r a hands-on workshop reinforced that scalable apps require decoupling. we used aws step functions to orchestrate the specific order workflow the ""recipe"" and amazon eventbridge to choreograph the communication between microservices order manager vs. publisher. day 2: the new standard for integration if day 1 was about logic, day 2 was about plumbing. how do we actually connect these agents to our tools without writing endless glue code?

reidhoffman,"We are in the opening chapters of a cognitive industrial revolution. And for the United States, two elements now sit at the center of whether we lead this revolution or watch it happen from a distance: compute sovereignty and energy sovereignty . We've seen article after article about whether or not we’re in an AI Bubble. Included in those articles have been stories about how data centers are popping up all across the US ––and the world–– to train large language models. Naturally, people are asking themselves if this is a glimpse into a new reality, or just the result of AI opulence in the economy. When it comes to datacenters, I think we’re just getting started. Data centers are the power plants of cognition . They are the places where demand for the next generation is filled—and the demand for compute is effectively unbounded. This isn’t just because we need it to train AI, but because we’ll need more inference and cloud capability as more parts of the economy come online. We tend to underestimate how much compute we will want, because every time we make models more capable, we invent new uses. If the AI agents that will increasingly help run companies, design drugs, defend networks, and coordinate logistics need to run somewhere. The question we must ask is: Do you want the agents that are amplifying human work to be domiciled in the U.S. or not? If this technology is running on infrastructure in the US, under American law, with American workers maintaining them, then a huge portion of the value stack stays here. The downstream effects of that are enormous, bringing positive economic benefits to the country, but also ideally to the local communities in which these datacenters reside. If they are elsewhere, the answer to many follow-on questions ( Where does the IP live? Who protects the data? Who benefits from the spillover? ) shifts in ways that do not favor American interests. Energy abundance is the precondition for compute abundance . In 2024, U.S. data centers consumed ~183 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, roughly 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption. That energy consumption is projected to climb by 133% to 426 TWh by 2030, if growth continues, according to Pew Research. To meet demand for compute, the US needs far more energy than it is currently producing. That means modernizing permitting, de-risking long-horizon energy investments, building new transmission, and accelerating every form of generation: solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, natural gas, long-duration storage. Energy and compute will become the new hard infrastructure. They are the rails and ports and highways of the intelligence age. If we build them here, the United States will lead the next century of economic growth and democratic innovation. If we do not, others will.

reidhoffman,"Like millions of other people, my first encounter with Siddhartha Mukherjee , my co-founder at Manas AI , was through his 2010 book, The Emperor of All Maladies . As much as Maladies is a sweeping medical history filled with detailed accounts of oncological research and treatment protocols, it's also a gripping narrative, at turns dramatic, intimate, and unfailingly frank about cancer's devastating impacts on patients, their families, and caregivers alike. In fact, Sid, who started writing Maladies after completing his medical residency and undertaking advanced training in medical oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, describes the book as a ""biography"" of cancer, an attempt to ""understand its personality"" and ""demystify its behavior."" To defeat an enemy, after all, you have to know it deeply. Why does it act one way in some scenarios, and differently in others? What new tools have we developed to fight it? How do new discoveries like these change our concepts of its nature? Like any biography of a living subject, this one demands updates. In the years following Maladies ' publication, checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and an immunotherapy revolution transformed oncology in fundamental ways. So with his characteristic storytelling prowess, Sid documents and contextualizes these changes in four new chapters exploring the computational and biological breakthroughs reshaping treatment today. As The Emperor of All Maladies evolves, Sid's long-term commitment to researching, treating, and ultimately defeating cancer have taken on new dimensions too. What I learned about Sid when I asked him in May 2024 for his perspective on potential uses of AI in drug discovery is that in addition to being a practicing physician, researcher, and author, Sid is a serial entrepreneur who has co-founded multiple cancer therapeutics companies over the last decade, focusing on cancer metabolism, immunotherapy, genetics, CAR-T and more. So our broad discussions about how AI might amplify and accelerate drug discovery quickly evolved into a shared vision to co-found a company, along with Ujjwal Singh, specifically devoted to using generative chemistry models and advanced AI filters to compress drug discovery times from decades to years. At Manas AI, Sid is applying all he has learned throughout his career in pursuit of a new twist to cancer's biography that will first be written in labs, through efforts like Project Cosmos, which aims to map the fundamental rules of how drug molecules bind with biological targets. Across his career, Sid has always worked at the intersections of science and storytelling, reflection and action. With the release of this new edition of The Emperor of All Maladies, that has never been clearer.

tian-chong-ng-76739216,"What can we expect in 2021? I’ll be frank. There are more questions and more uncertainty than I can ever recall at any other moment in recent memory. The level of disruption, the constant redefining of a new normal has left everyone in a state of flux. But not to downplay this monumental challenge before us. This is truly a time of opportunity. History shows crises spark record acceleration in development. We’ve seen two years of digital transformation in two months! That’s unprecedented. A massive shift across all business and society to online and a digital way of life. What COVID has done has reset expectations on the way we live, work and play. And this presents boundless opportunities for technology. But opportunities that technologists like us at HP must use to genuinely impact everyone for the better. While answers remain a rare commodity, here are my five predictions for how technology can potentially change things for the better in 2021 and how Asia can be at the heart of many of these trends. 1. Imperative for digital integration to realize digital economies and society A World Economic Forum study shows that an estimated 60-70% of new value created in the economy over the next decade will be based on digitally-enabled platforms. Globally the US is in position to drive this revolution and the US-Japan Digital Trade Agreement is evidence of it assuming a global leadership role. But China has declared its mission to build a digital silk road across ASEAN. This will clearly spark broader and tighter digital integration for businesses and governments across the Asia Pacific region. To tap these growth opportunities, communities at all levels must accelerate the move to digital. New capabilities and an unprecedented focus on data will transform the models of business, work, learning and play accelerate change with new vigor. How we manage this change and interact in this digital economy will be crucial to personal, societal and commercial development. 2. New normal drives universal upskilling around personal, fluid, and life-long learning models The last 12 months has put a spotlight on people and business being future-proof. This requires new knowledge, a new level of agility and adaptability for business leaders and for individuals from all generations and all areas of society. For business leaders and corporate professionals, there’s a need to lead and collaborate across a diverse workforce – across locations, profiles, capabilities and cultures. There is a stark realization that digital skills need elevating at all levels and across all generations. The impact on schools has had huge implications in society for students, but most of all for parents and teachers as they nurture the next generation of professionals and leaders. Learning in the future must be personalized, fluid and life-long. 3. The rise of the ‘wherever office’ -- a hybrid of virtual, physical but secure at all times The blueprint for future cities and future working environments are being formulated as the world emerges from COVID-19. Smaller offices, distributed corporate footprints and a shift to the suburbs will see new ways of working emerge. The “Wherever Office” and a truly digital and virtual workplace made mobile across a spectrum of locations will be the norm . Optimal collaboration, personalization and a custom experience will be key to ensuring a productive and effective workforce. This comes at the cost of growing risks to data, users and business integrity. The future of work must be a seamless hybrid model of virtual and physical, but be secure at all times. 4. 4th Industrial Revolution accelerated manufacturing and supply chain shifts with additive printing demand surging Global supply chains will face continued disruption and change which is revolutionizing the manufacturing sector. The acceleration of the 4th Industrial Revolution in manufacturing enabled by AI, IoT, additive printing among others saw rapid innovation to meet demand in pandemic-related products. HP itself leveraged its market-leading print innovation capabilities to ramp up production lines for critical ventilator parts and PPE such as surgical masks. This new-found capability has opened up possibilities for distributed manufacturing and home manufacturing models. The additive printing market is projected to be worth $45B by 2030 with Asia fast catching the US as the leading region. Manufacturers and consumers are primed to take advantage of this emerging opportunity to produce on-demand and drive new economic opportunities. 5. The Great Reset to drive unstoppable tech for good movement The year ahead will see companies and brands be judged by more than the profits they generate. They will also be measured by the value they create for society as a whole. For technology, our goals must now incorporate the ideals of inclusivity, equality, and sustainability. Tech leaders must build trust in emerging technologies like AI, 5G, Blockchain, and robotics. As industry leaders, we must empower communities through the power of technology. Help eliminate the digital divide that prevents too many from accessing the education, jobs and healthcare they need to thrive. HP continues to drive toward a net zero carbon, fully regenerative economy while creating the industry’s most sustainable portfolio of technology, services and solutions. HP was built for this moment. We stand for a new era of opportunity – where human rights are universally protected, climate change reversed, and the digital divide eliminated for all. To conclude I want to put this reset opportunity in terms that should leave no doubt over why we must act with purpose. A recent report by Nature magazine notes that 2020 is now officially the year the Earth reached a critical crossover point in that the total produce of humans surpassed all global living biomass. In plain terms, the total mass of human-made materials in the world is now greater than the impact of all living things. World War 2 saw the “Great Acceleration” in urban and industrial development. We are at a similar moment today but let’s be sure we use this reset to deliver good on ALL levels, for ALL people and ALL

tarof,"🎉 Portfolio Highlight: Mastra 🎉 Mastra is an open-source TypeScript framework that helps developers build, deploy, and scale AI agents and agent-powered applications in production. It provides the core infrastructure needed to move from prototype to real-world systems, including workflows, memory, tool calling, evals, tracing, and integrations across modern JavaScript stacks. The platform is designed to make agent development accessible to the massive ecosystem of frontend and full-stack engineers who already build with JavaScript and TypeScript. As AI shifts from simple copilots to autonomous software, Mastra is positioning itself as a foundational layer for agentic development. Teams can use it to automate business workflows, build embedded assistants inside products, and orchestrate multi-step reasoning systems with reliability and guardrails. The framework is seeing strong developer adoption and enterprise usage, with companies leveraging it to power support automation, internal tools, and domain-specific AI workflows. By owning the developer layer for agent infrastructure, Mastra has the potential to become a key part of the agent stack as more software becomes AI-native. Mastra was founded by Sam Bhagwat , Shane Thomas , and Abhi Aiyer .

alexchriss,"Whether you’ve recently hung up your shingle or you’re a seasoned small business veteran, the start of a new year is the perfect time to take a fresh look at your operation by reviewing the year that’s passed and making necessary adjustments as you plan for the future. It’s the beginning of 2018 and a good time to plan. Small business owners are typically spread thin during the holiday season and even the most diligent ones may find themselves behind on their checklist. If this scenario sounds familiar, don’t worry - it’s not too late to tackle the important items. Here’s a list, with input from accounting professionals in the Intuit QuickBooks ProAdvisor community , of the five most critical to-dos for any small business owner, to ensure smooth sailing throughout the year ahead: 1. Keep your finances up to date. Work on your accounting on a weekly basis so you can keep a finger on the pulse of your finances at all times. Knowing your numbers in real-time can help a small business realize if they are in good shape, or flag issues. Waiting until the end of the year, quarter or even month is too long to find out that the business needs to make changes. 2. Implement a system for managing tasks. While your business is still new and/or things haven’t quite picked up, implement systems to manage tasks. It will be much more difficult to get your to-do list under control once business picks up and you’re busy, which can put you at risk for losing customers, vendors or even your mind! 3. Get ahead of taxes. As an individual, you know that tax day arrives in April. But as a small business owner, you’re probably aware that there are tax deadlines you must meet well before the April 17 deadline. Start preparing for tax filing now , and you’ll meet these deadlines with ease, and save yourself a headache in a few months. Here’s a quick rundown of how to get the process moving: · Pick a strategy. Will you use an accountant, do it all yourself, or something in-between (like doing it yourself with the help of a CPA advisor on-demand during tax season or a ProAdvisor for help throughout the year). · Mark your calendar with important tax deadlines to ensure you file on time. You can sign up for email reminders directly from the IRS here . · Don’t forget that W-2s (for employees) and 1099s (for contractors) were required to have been sent to recipients and submitted to the IRS by January 31. · Collect all necessary tax forms for the type of business entity you have established. You can find a list of forms here . · Organize your business-related expense records and receipts that are critical for maximizing write-offs. 4. Finalize your staffing plan. One of the biggest business decisions you’ll have to make is whether or not to hire employees in the coming year. Consider your new goals, expectations for customer demand, and current staff level to project your 2018 staffing needs. If you’re on a limited budget or only need intermittent help, consider leveraging freelancers or other on-demand talent who can assist with projects as-needed. If you do plan to staff up, just make sure your budget and business plan support the additional headcount. 5. Beware of competing on price. There will always be someone willing to do things cheaper so be careful about competing on price. Instead, compete on your service level or something else that makes your business unique. Price shoppers will always follow the cheaper price, but customers that truly value your unique offering or service are more likely to stick around. In an ideal world, we’d all have our to-do lists checked well before the beginning of the year to guarantee a solid start to the new year. But regardless of when you plan, the important thing is to get it done. If you’re like the many small business owners who find themselves late to the game, don’t fret. Use this time as a catalyst to kickstart the planning process and get it back on track. Remember: the more organized you stay throughout the year, the easier this process will be by year’s end.

travisbradberry,"Nobel Prize winner Edith Wharton once said, “There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.” This is an amazingly accurate description of the difference between Type A and Type B personalities. Type A personalities are the candles—and they’re usually burning at both ends. Type B personalities, on the other hand, put out every bit as much light; they just don’t get as much recognition for it. Type Bs don’t have all of that sparkle and sizzle that attract everyone’s attention. Since Type Bs aren’t as in your face about their contributions, they have a tendency to get mislabeled as lazy or indifferent. That bias goes all the way back to the origin of the Type A/Type B personality paradigm, in the waiting room of a couple of cardiologists. The doctors noticed that their chairs didn’t have wear on the backs as expected; it was only visible on the front edge of the seats and the armrests, which suggested that patients were literally waiting on the edge of their seats, ready to jump up the second their names were called. So, the cardiologists—Doctors Friedman and Rosenman—then wanted to find out if impatient people were more prone to heart disease. They discovered that their hunch was correct, and they labeled these impatient individuals ""Type A."" ""Type B"" was simply a label they assigned to anyone who wasn’t Type A. It’s as if Type Bs lack the distinguishing characteristics that drive them to be successful. Type Bs, however, know that this couldn’t be further from the truth. The very traits that people assume are the products of laziness or indifference are distinct personality characteristics that help Type Bs to achieve and prosper. Unlike Type As, Type Bs don’t feel like they have to be perfect, which means they are OK with recognizing and admitting their weaknesses. This acknowledgment equips them to shore up those weaknesses. Type Bs are also easier to get along with, as they tend to be supportive rather than rushing, pushing, and criticizing others. Type Bs don’t jump to conclusions. Since they’re not in a constant rush, they take the time to analyze all the facts instead of hurrying their analysis just to reach a decision. Type Bs also won’t keep beating a dead horse. Whereas Type As can become obsessed with making their chosen strategy work, Type Bs easily switch gears when it becomes obvious something isn’t working. In a nutshell, Type B personalities deserve a lot more credit than they get. To fully grasp what it means to be Type B, you need to hear it from the horse’s mouth. Don’t take my word for it—let’s see what they have to say: #1 - We’re not lazy; we’re just laid-back. Just because our goals aren’t pulsating like strobe lights on our foreheads doesn’t mean we don’t have any. We have goals, and we care about them just as much as you care about yours. But we see achieving those goals as a journey, not a sprint. We may stop and smell the proverbial roses along the way, but we still stay focused on where we’re going and what we need to do to get there. #2 - We have a plan. Just because we’re not barreling from step one to step two at breakneck speed doesn’t mean we don’t have a plan. We do. We just keep it to ourselves and follow it quietly rather than assigning time-keepers and judges to monitor our progress and help us stay on track. #3 - We care. Being laid-back is not the same as being disengaged or indifferent. The truth is that we care enough to work at the pace we’re most effective. If we didn’t care, we’d let you rush us even if that compromised quality. #4 - We’re content. We think it’s great that you’re so focused on your goals, but we simply don’t think as much about “What’s next?” because we’re pretty happy right where we are. In fact, we Type B people report a higher level of satisfaction with our lives, and that lets us enjoy today without worrying so much about what we’re going to achieve tomorrow. #5 - We’re healthier than you are. Overall, we suffer less stress, which can lead to everything from heart disease and insomnia to relationship problems and substance abuse. Our ability to relax not only paves the way for better decision-making, it also helps us maintain a healthy weight, avoid cancer, and fight off infections. #6 - We make great friends. We see the best in everyone—including you. Since we don’t view life as a competition, we’re the first to cheer you on and to support you along the way. And we cheer and support you , not just your achievements. We think that Robert Louis Stevenson knew what he was talking about when he said, “Don’t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.” #7 - We work best when we’re allowed to color outside of the lines. Don’t give us a paint-by-numbers kit; we’d much rather have a blank canvas and a shiny new palette of colors. While you’re squinting at those small spaces, trying to make sure you stay within the lines, we’re backing up all the way across the room so we can see the big picture. #8 - We like group projects. We know you don’t like group projects, and we know why: there are always a few group members who don’t feel that every second has to be accounted for or who don’t share your sense of urgency to do everything NOW! We focus on the process as well as the outcome. We’re happy to share the successes, the failures, and the credit, and we enjoy the give-and-take and collaboration that are part of working with a group, even if it slows things down a bit. #9 - We admire and respect you — but we wouldn’t trade places. We’re awed by your drive and by your breathtaking pace. We recognize the rewards that come your way, and we’re impressed. But we’re wise enough to know that we’re not wired that way. We’d be miserable, and so would everyone around us. So, we’re content to hang out in the slow lane and see you at the finish line. We’ll be the ones who are smiling calmly, rather than gasping for breath. Moving Forward We really don’t mind ceding the limelight to Type A personalities; just don’t count us out. We have a lot to offer, and we want to contribute. We want to succeed at a high level. However, we’d rather enjoy the game and leave the scorekeeping to somebody else. After all, it doesn’t matter until the game is over. What other characteristics set Type B people apart?

""type b"" was simply a label they assigned to anyone who wasnt type a. its as if type bs lack the distinguishing characteristics that drive them to be successful. type bs, however, know that this couldnt be further from the truth. the very traits that people assume are the products of laziness or indifference are distinct personality characteristics that help type bs to achieve and prosper. unlike type as, type bs dont feel like they have to be perfect, which means they are ok with recognizing and admitting their weaknesses. this acknowledgment equips them to shore up those weaknesses. type bs are also easier to get along with, as they tend to be supportive rather than rushing, pushing, and criticizing others. type bs dont jump to conclusions. since theyre not in a constant rush, they take the time to analyze all the facts instead of hurrying their analysis just to reach a decision. type bs also wont keep beating a dead horse. whereas type as can become obsessed with making their chosen strategy work, type bs easily switch gears when it becomes obvious something isnt working. in a nutshell, type b personalities deserve a lot more credit than they get. to fully grasp what it means to be type b, you need to hear it from the horses mouth. dont take my word for itlets see what they have to say: #1 - were not lazy; were just laid-back. just because our goals arent pulsating like strobe lights on our foreheads doesnt mean we dont have any. we have goals, and we care about them just as much as you care about yours. but we see achieving those goals as a journey, not a sprint. we may stop and smell the proverbial roses along the way, but we still stay focused on where were going and what we need to do to get there. #2 - we have a plan. just because were not barreling from step one to step two at breakneck speed doesnt mean we dont have a plan. we do. we just keep it to ourselves and follow it quietly rather than assigning time-keepers and judges to monitor our progress and help us stay on track. #3 - we care. being laid-back is not the same as being disengaged or indifferent. the truth is that we care enough to work at the pace were most effective. if we didnt care, wed let you rush us even if that compromised quality. #4 - were content. we think its great that youre so focused on your goals, but we simply dont think as much about whats next? because were pretty happy right where we are. in fact, we type b people report a higher level of satisfaction with our lives, and that lets us enjoy today without worrying so much about what were going to achieve tomorrow. #5 - were healthier than you are. overall, we suffer less stress, which can lead to everything from heart disease and insomnia to relationship problems and substance abuse. our ability to relax not only paves the way for better decision-making, it also helps us maintain a healthy weight, avoid cancer, and fight off infections. #6 - we make great friends. we see the best in everyoneincluding you. since we dont view life as a competition, were the first to cheer you on and to support you along the way. and we cheer and support you , not just your achievements. we think that robert louis stevenson knew what he was talking about when he said, dont judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant. #7 - we work best when were allowed to color outside of the lines. dont give us a paint-by-numbers kit; wed much rather have a blank canvas and a shiny new palette of colors. while youre squinting at those small spaces, trying to make sure you stay within the lines, were backing up all the way across the room so we can see the big picture. #8 - we like group projects. we know you dont like group projects, and we know why: there are always a few group members who dont feel that every second has to be accounted for or who dont share your sense of urgency to do everything now! we focus on the process as well as the outcome. were happy to share the successes, the failures, and the credit, and we enjoy the give-and-take and collaboration that are part of working with a group, even if it slows things down a bit. #9 - we admire and respect you  but we wouldnt trade places. were awed by your drive and by your breathtaking pace. we recognize the rewards that come your way, and were impressed. but were wise enough to know that were not wired that way. wed be miserable, and so would everyone around us. so, were content to hang out in the slow lane and see you at the finish line. well be the ones who are smiling calmly, rather than gasping for breath. moving forward we really dont mind ceding the limelight to type a personalities; just dont count us out. we have a lot to offer, and we want to contribute. we want to succeed at a high level. however, wed rather enjoy the game and leave the scorekeeping to somebody else. after all, it doesnt matter until the game is over. what other characteristics set type b people apart?

qi-han-wong-34955261,"I looked up a restaurant on Google Maps for a quick weekday dinner - 4.1/5. Not bad for a local tze char restaurant, so in I went. The food was alright, and the service... left much to be desired. Solid 1.8 in my books. What went wrong? For the sake of my calories, I compiled data on all 3,000+ unique restaurants in Singapore and built a machine-learning model with Google Maps API and Antigravity so that I can better select my next dinner spot. Try it out here . The Problem Every ""Best Restaurants"" list suffers from the same bias: digital visibility. High-rated restaurants attract more visits, which lead to more reviews. More reviews boost visibility, which drives more visits. It's a self-reinforcing loop that overlooks great food elsewhere. I wanted to build something different: a system that strips away the visibility bias to find restaurants that are statistically over- or under-performing their context. Couple of caveats: First, I left out government-run hawker centers as they operate on a different scale and deserve their own model. Second, I know reviews can be artificially inflated with promos (e.g. ""Steven is excellent!"" for free dessert) or bots, so a future build could account for that by analysing sentiment and the actual content. Third, some restaurants may have been left out because of incomplete data. This still very much a V1 MVP. Easter egg: The data accidentally (but happily) captured parts of Johor Bahru, so you can find gems for your weekend trips too. The Interesting Findings Industrial areas hide gems. The top finds are in Sungei Kadut, Tuas, and Tengah. These are places most food guides ignore. The ""Marina Bay Premium"" is Real. Location explains nearly 50% of a rating. An average restaurant in the CBD will statistically drift towards 4.6 stars, while a superior one in Jurong fights to hit 4.2. The model exposes this gap. Chain restaurants are predictable. Most chain restaurants (McDonald's, Saizeriya, etc.) have near-zero gaps. They perform as the model predicts. One exception is the Burger King in SAFRA Choa Chu Kang - they're doing something special here! Top Gems Largest Gaps The Approach: Gap Analysis The core approach is borrowed from finance: alpha = actual return - expected return. Applied to restaurants: gap = actual rating - predicted rating If a restaurant has a 4.6 rating, but the model predicted 4.0 based on its location, cuisine, and review count—that's a +0.6 gap. Probably a gem, assuming it hasn't been boosted artificially. Sorting out bots/promos is a problem for another day. Conversely, a 4.2-rated restaurant in a prime location with many reviews might have a negative gap. It's underperforming its context. Step 1: Data Collection I compiled data via Google Maps API and analysed restaurant name, rating, review count, coordinates, category. After deduplication by keeping the record with the highest review count per restaurant name, I had 3,333 unique restaurants . Step 2: LLM Classification A bit of LLM intervention needed as many entries did not classify the cuisine type (generic ""Other"" rather than ""BBQ""). BATCH_PROMPT = """"""Classify each restaurant into ONE of these categories: Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese, Malay, Western, Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Seafood, Cafe, Fast Food, BBQ, Other Restaurant names: {names} Respond with: ""Name | Category"" for each."""""" I sent 20 restaurants per API call, with 6-second rate limiting. Total time: 7 minutes . Total cost: $0.00 (within free tier). ""Other"" category dropped from 38% to 13%. The model now had meaningful cuisine signals. Step 3: Model Build The model uses five features to predict expected rating: The big insight: location dominates. Nearly half of the rating variance is explained by where the restaurant is, not what it serves. Step 4: Model Training I used HistGradientBoostingRegressor from scikit-learn—a robust, fast algorithm that handles categorical features natively. model = Pipeline([ ('preprocessor', ColumnTransformer([ ('cat', OrdinalEncoder(), ['category', 'planning_area']), ('num', 'passthrough', ['log_reviews', 'is_chain', 'cluster_density']) ])), ('regressor', HistGradientBoostingRegressor( categorical_features=[0, 1], l2_regularization=1.0 )) ]) Cross-validation RMSE: 0.42 (meaning predictions are typically within 0.4 stars of actual). Training time: 2 seconds . Step 5: Calculating Gaps gdf['predicted_rating'] = model.predict(X) gdf['gap'] = gdf['rating'] - gdf['predicted_rating'] Restaurants with gaps ≥ 0.5 are flagged as Gems (teal). Gaps between 0 and 0.5 are Fair Value (yellow). Gaps below 0 are Overvalued (coral). Step 6: The Interactive Map Built with Streamlit + PyDeck for GPU-accelerated map rendering. Key features: Color-coded dots based on gap Sidebar filters: Planning Area, Cuisine, Min Rating, ""Gems Only"" toggle Dynamic tooltips explaining why each restaurant is rated that way Example tooltip: ""With Japanese cuisine, 87 reviews, similar spots in ORCHARD average 4.1.

Instead, they’re tripling entry-level roles in 2026 - including software developers. While 37% of companies say they plan to replace early-career jobs with AI. Here’s what they realized: The old entry-level job? AI can do most of it. So IBM didn’t cut the role.

travisbradberry,"Difficult bosses contaminate the workplace. Some do so obliviously, while others smugly manipulate their employees. The “bad boss” has become a comedic part of work culture, permeating movies and television, but when you actually work for one, there’s nothing funny about it. Bad bosses cause irrevocable damage by hindering your performance and creating unnecessary stress. The stress they create is terrible for your health. Multiple studies have found that working for a bad boss increases your chance of having a heart attack by as much as 50%. Even more troubling is the number of bad bosses out there. Gallup research found that 60% of government workers are miserable because of bad bosses. In another study 69% of US workers compared bosses with too much power to toddlers with too much power. The comparisons don’t stop there. Significant percentages of US workers describe their bosses as self-oriented (60%), stubborn (49%), and overly demanding (43%). Most bosses aren’t surprised by these statistics. A DDI study found that 64% of managers admit that they need to work on their management skills. When asked where they should focus their efforts, managers overwhelmingly say, “Bringing in the numbers”; yet, they are most often fired for poor people skills. So what do most people working for bad bosses do about it? Not much. While 27% of people working for a bad boss quit as soon as they secure a new job and 11% quit without having secured a new job, an amazing 59% stay put. That’s an alarming number of people who are living with overwhelming stress and experiencing the trickle-down effects this has on their sanity and health. Millions of people have taken my emotional intelligence tests, and I’ve found that 90% of top performers are skilled at managing their emotions in times of stress in order to remain calm and in control. One of their greatest gifts is the ability to neutralize difficult people—even those they report to. This is no easy task. It requires a great deal of emotional intelligence, a skill that top performers rely on. While the best option when you have a bad boss is to seek other employment, this isn’t always possible. Successful people know how to make the most of a bad situation. A bad boss doesn’t deter them because they understand that success is simply the product of how well you can play the hand you’ve been dealt. When that “hand” is a bad boss, you can identify the type of bad boss you're working for and then use this information to neutralize your boss’ behavior. What follows are the most common types of bad bosses and the strategies you can employ to neutralize them. The Tyrant - The tyrant resorts to Machiavellian tactics and constantly makes decisions that feed his ego. His primary concern is maintaining power, and he will coerce and intimidate others to do so. The tyrant thinks of his employees as a criminal gang aboard his ship. He classifies people in his mind and treats them accordingly: High achievers who challenge his thinking are treated as mutinous. Those who support their achievements with gestures of loyalty find themselves in the position of first mate. Those who perform poorly are stuck cleaning the latrines and swabbing the decks. How to neutralize a tyrant: A painful but effective strategy with the tyrant is to present your ideas in a way that allows him to take partial credit. The tyrant can then maintain his ego without having to shut down your idea. Always be quick to give him some credit, even though he is unlikely to reciprocate, because this will inevitably put you on his good side. Also, to survive a tyrant, you must choose your battles wisely. If you practice self-awareness and manage your emotions, you can rationally choose which battles are worth fighting and which ones you should just let go. This way, you won’t find yourself on latrine duty. The Micromanager - This is the boss who makes you feel as if you are under constant surveillance. She thought your handwriting could use improvement, so she waited until you left work at 7:00 p.m. to throw away your pencils and replace them with the .9 lead mechanical pencils that have the “proper grip.” She has even handed back your 20-page report because you used a binder clip instead of a staple. The micromanager pays too much attention to small details, and her constant hovering makes employees feel discouraged, frustrated, and even uncomfortable. How to neutralize a micromanager: Successful people appeal to micromanagers by proving themselves to be flexible, competent, and disciplined while staying in constant communication. A micromanager is naturally drawn to the employee who produces work the way she envisions. The challenge with the micromanager is grasping the “envisioned way.” To do this, try asking specific questions about your project, check in frequently, and look for trends in the micromanager’s feedback. Of course, this will not always work. Some micromanagers will never stop searching for something to over-analyze and micromanage. When this is the case, you must learn to derive your sense of satisfaction from within. Don’t allow your boss’ obsession with details to create feelings of inadequacy as this will only lead to further stress and underperformance. Remember, a good report without a staple is still a good report. Despite your boss’ fixation on detail, she appreciates your work; she just doesn’t know how to show it. The Incompetent - This boss was promoted hastily or hired haphazardly and holds a position that is beyond his capabilities. Most likely, he is not completely incompetent, but he has people who report to him that have been at the company a lot longer and have information and skills that he lacks. How to neutralize an incompetent: If you find yourself frustrated with this type of boss, it is likely because you have experience that he lacks. It is important to swallow your pride and share your experience and knowledge, without rubbing it in his face. Share the information that this boss needs to grow into his role, and you’ll become his ally and confidant. The Robot - In the mind of the robot, you are employee number 72 with a production yield of 84 percent and experience level 91. This boss makes decisions based on the numbers, and when she’s forced to reach a conclusion without the proper data, she self-destructs. She makes little or no effort to connect with her employees, and instead, looks solely to the numbers to decide who is invaluable and who needs to go. How to neutralize a robot: To succeed with a robot, you need to speak her language. When you have an idea, make certain you have the data to back it up. The same goes with your performance—you need to know what she values and be able to show it to her if you want to prove your worth. Once you’ve accomplished this, you can begin trying to nudge her out of her antisocial comfort zone. The trick is to find ways to connect with her directly, without being pushy or rude. Schedule face-to-face meetings and respond to some of her e-mails by knocking on her door. Forcing her to connect with you as a person, however so slightly, will make you more than a list of numbers and put a face to your name. Just because she’s all about the numbers, it doesn’t mean you can’t make yourself the exception. Do so in small doses, however, because she’s unlikely to respond well to the overbearing social type. The Seagull - We’ve all been there—sitting in the shadow of a seagull manager who decided it was time to roll up his sleeves, swoop in, and squawk up a storm. Instead of taking the time to get the facts straight and work alongside the team to realize a viable solution, the seagull deposits steaming piles of formulaic advice and then abruptly takes off, leaving everyone else behind to clean up the mess. Seagulls interact with their employees only when there’s a fire to put out. Even then, they move in and out so hastily—and put so little thought into their approach—that they make bad situations worse by frustrating and alienating those who need them the most. How to neutralize a seagull: A group approach works best with seagulls. If you can get the entire team to sit down with him and explain that his abrupt approach to solving problems makes it extremely difficult for everyone to perform at their best, this message is likely to be heard. If the entire group bands together and provides constructive, non-threatening feedback, the seagull will more often than not find a better way to work with his team. It’s easy to spot a seagull when you’re on the receiving end of their airborne dumps, but the manager doing the squawking is often unaware of the negative impact of his behavior. Have the group give him a little nudge, and things are bound to change for the better. The Visionary - Her strength lies in her ideas and innovations. However, this entrepreneurial approach becomes dangerous when a plan or solution needs to be implemented, and she can’t bring herself to focus on the task at hand. When the time comes to execute her vision, she’s already off onto the next idea, and you’re left to figure things out on your own. How to neutralize a visionary: To best deal with this type, reverse her train of thought. She naturally takes a broad perspective, so be quick to funnel things down into something smaller and more practical. To do so, ask a lot of specific questions that force her to rationally approach the issue and to consider potential obstacles to executing her broad ideas. Don’t refute her ideas directly, or she will feel criticized; instead, focus her attention on what it will take to realistically implement her plan. Oftentimes, your questions will diffuse her plan, and when they don’t, they’ll get her to understand—and commit to—the effort it’s going to take on her part to help make it happen. The Inappropriate Buddy - This is the boss who’s too friendly, and not in the fun, team-building sort of way. He is constantly inviting you to hang out outside of work and engages in unnecessary office gossip. He uses his influence to make friends at the expense of his work. He chooses favorites and creates divisions among employees, who become frustrated by the imbalance in attention and respect. He can’t make tough decisions involving employees or even fire those who need to be fired (unless he doesn’t like them). His office quickly becomes The Office. How to neutralize an inappropriate buddy: The most important thing to do with this type of boss is to learn to set firm boundaries. Don’t allow his position to intimidate you. By consciously and proactively establishing a boundary, you can take control of the situation. For example, you can remain friendly with your boss throughout the day but still not be afraid to say no to drinks after work. The difficult part here is maintaining consistency with your boundaries, even if your boss is persistent. By distancing yourself from his behaviors that you deem inappropriate, you will still be able to succeed and even have a healthy relationship with your boss. It’s important you don’t put up unnecessary boundaries that stop you from being seen as friendly (ideally, a friend). Instead of trying to change the crowd-pleaser and force him to be something he’s not, having him see you as an ally will put you in a stronger position than you could have anticipated.

instead, focus her attention on what it will take to realistically implement her plan. oftentimes, your questions will diffuse her plan, and when they dont, theyll get her to understandand commit tothe effort its going to take on her part to help make it happen. the inappropriate buddy - this is the boss whos too friendly, and not in the fun, team-building sort of way. he is constantly inviting you to hang out outside of work and engages in unnecessary office gossip. he uses his influence to make friends at the expense of his work. he chooses favorites and creates divisions among employees, who become frustrated by the imbalance in attention and respect. he cant make tough decisions involving employees or even fire those who need to be fired unless he doesnt like them. his office quickly becomes the office. how to neutralize an inappropriate buddy: the most important thing to do with this type of boss is to learn to set firm boundaries. dont allow his position to intimidate you. by consciously and proactively establishing a boundary, you can take control of the situation. for example, you can remain friendly with your boss throughout the day but still not be afraid to say no to drinks after work. the difficult part here is maintaining consistency with your boundaries, even if your boss is persistent. by distancing yourself from his behaviors that you deem inappropriate, you will still be able to succeed and even have a healthy relationship with your boss. its important you dont put up unnecessary boundaries that stop you from being seen as friendly ideally, a friend. instead of trying to change the crowd-pleaser and force him to be something hes not, having him see you as an ally will put you in a stronger position than you could have anticipated. moving forward if you think these strategies might help others, please share this article with your network. research suggests that roughly half of them are currently working for a difficult boss! what other advice would you give to those who are working for a difficult boss? please share your thoughts in the comments section, as i learn just as much from you as you do from me. if you enjoyed this article, click the subscribe button below and you'll receive a new one just like it each week. about the author: you'll love his new book, the new emotional intelligence . dr. bradberry is the world's #1 bestselling emotional intelligence author, having sold more than 5 million copies. he has written for, or been covered by, time, usa today, the wall street journal, bloomberg businessweek, fortune, forbes, fast company, and the harvard business review. if you'd like to learn how to increase your eq, consider taking the test that's included via unique passcode in the new emotional intelligence book. your test results will reveal which of the book's 60 strategies will increase your eq the most.",-15,too_long,difficult bosses contaminate the workplace,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,6,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,12,2,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,74,74

travisbradberry,"Successful people come from all walks of life, yet they all have one thing in common: where others see impenetrable barriers, they see challenges to embrace and obstacles to overcome. Their confidence in the face of hardship is driven by their ability to let go of the negativity that holds so many otherwise sensible people back. Obstacles do not block the path; they are the path. This perspective helps successful people to think differently to everyone else, which is important, because if you think like everyone else, no matter how smart or experienced you are, you’ll hit the same ceiling. By thinking outside the box and going against the grain, successful people rise above their limitations. We all know how important it is to approach problems with radical optimism and creativity, but this is easier said than done. In a study conducted at Adobe, 96% of employees identified creativity as essential to their success, both in terms of their income and the value they bring to the world. What’s more, 78% wished they were capable of thinking differently, believing that they would progress through their careers more quickly if they did. Too often we attribute creative and “different” thinking to natural, innate characteristics that belong only to the lucky. The truth is that you can study how ridiculously successful people think and incorporate their approach into your repertoire. 1. They’re confident. If only we knew of all the great ideas that never came to fruition because people lacked the confidence to put them into action. Successful people confidently act on their ideas, because they know that a failed idea is not a reflection of their ability; instead, they see it as a wonderful learning opportunity. 2. They’re composed. Ultra-successful people are composed, because they constantly monitor their emotions and understand them and they use this knowledge in the moment to react with self-control to challenging situations. When things go downhill, they are persistently calm and frustratingly content (frustrating to those who aren’t, at least). They know that no matter how good or bad things get, everything changes with time. All they can do is to adapt and adjust to stay happy and in control. 3. They’re honest. Super-successful people trust that honesty and integrity, though painful at times, always work out for the best in the long run. They know that honesty allows for genuine connections with people and that lying always comes back to bite you in the end. In fact, a Notre Dame study showed that people who often lied experienced more mental health problems than their more honest counterparts. 4. They seek out small victories. Successful people like to challenge themselves and to compete, even when their efforts yield only small victories. Small victories build new androgen receptors in the areas of the brain responsible for reward and motivation. This increase in androgen receptors enhances the influence of testosterone, which further increases their confidence and eagerness to tackle challenges. When you achieve a series of small victories, the boost in your confidence can last for months. 5. They’re always learning. Super-successful people often know more than others do, because they’re constantly trying to learn. They vow to constantly grow, and they fill every spare moment with self-education. They don’t do this because it’s “the right thing to do”; they do it because it’s their passion. They’re always looking for opportunities to improve and new things to learn about themselves and the world around them. Instead of succumbing to their fear of looking stupid, truly exceptional people just ask the questions on their mind, because they would rather learn something new than appear smart. 6. They expose themselves to a variety of people. There’s no easier way to learn to think differently than spending time with someone whose strengths are your weaknesses or whose ideas are radically different from your own. This exposure sparks new ideas and makes you well rounded. This is why we see so many great companies with co-founders who stand in stark contrast to each other. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Apple were a prime example. Neither could have succeeded without the other. 7. They keep an open mind. Exposing yourself to a variety of people is useless if you spend that time disagreeing with them and comforting yourself with your own opinions. Successful people recognize that every perspective provides an opportunity for growth. You need to practice empathy by putting yourself in the other person’s shoes so that you can understand how their perspective makes sense (at least, to them). A great way to keep an open mind is to try to glean at least one interesting or useful thing from every conversation you have. 8. They’re fearless. Fear is nothing more than a lingering emotion that’s fueled by your imagination. Danger is real. Danger is the uncomfortable rush of adrenaline you get when you almost step in front of a bus; fear is a choice. Exceptional people know this better than anyone does, so they flip fear on its head. Instead of letting fear take over, they’re addicted to the euphoric feeling they get from conquering their fears. 9. They turn tedious tasks into games. Every job entails some degree of tedium. For most people, tedium leads to sloppy, rushed work. Only the most successful people find ways to make the tedious interesting. By turning tedious work into a game, they challenge themselves and produce high-quality work, making things interesting in the process. 10. They dream big but remain grounded. Successful people reach for the seemingly impossible, but they do so in a way that is actionable and realistic. While you may not know exactly how you’re going to achieve your dream, you need to make progress no matter how small the steps. For example, Elon Musk’s goal at Spacex is to “Occupy Mars.” While this is a big dream, Musk keeps it realistic by engaging in regular steps that, some day, may get him there. Spacex was the first company to develop reuseable rocket boosters. It’s a far cry from colonizing Mars, but it’s an essential step in the process. Moving Forward The above behaviors can make any of us more successful if we use them every day. Give them a try, and see where they take you.

ankit-pangasa,"Building or working with anything connected to the internet? Chances are you'll bump into REST APIs . These are the backbone of modern web communication , and understanding their core principles is key to navigating the digital landscape. Let's demystify the magic! Here's a simple relatable explanation for different components of REST APIs. 1. Client and Server: The Two Sides of the Conversation Think of it like ordering food. You (the client - your app or browser) ask a waiter (server - the computer holding the data) for something. The server then gets it and sends it back. The cool thing is, the client and server can be updated separately without messing each other up too much. Your phone app doesn't need to know exactly how the restaurant's kitchen is run. 2. Keeping Things Forgetful: Statelessness Imagine going back to the same waiter for another order, but they have absolutely no memory of your previous order. That's kind of how statelessness works. Each request you (the client) make has to contain all the info the server needs right then and there. The server doesn't hold onto any memory of past chats. This makes the server simpler and able to handle lots of requests without getting confused. 3. Being Smart About Saving: Cacheability Ever notice how some websites load super fast after the first time? That's often because of caching. If the server sends back information that isn't going to change for a while (like the menu), it can tell your app (or browser) to save a copy. So, next time you need it, you get it instantly without even bothering the server again. Smart, right? 4. Organized Layers: The Layered System Think of a company with different departments. You (the client) talk to the front desk, who then talks to another department, and so on. Each layer only directly deals with the one right next to it. In REST, this means your request might go through a few different servers before reaching the actual data. This keeps things organized and makes it easier to update or swap out parts without breaking everything. 5. Sometimes Sending Extra Instructions: Code-on-Demand (Optional) This is a bit less common, but sometimes the server might send a little extra code (like some interactive bits for a webpage) along with the data. It's like the restaurant giving you a little recipe card for how to best enjoy your meal. 6. Speaking the Same Language: The Uniform Interface This is the real key to REST working well. It's like everyone agreeing to a standard way of communicating. Now, let's talk about the practical stuff you'll see when working with REST APIs: The Main Way They Talk: Protocol (Usually HTTP) Most REST APIs use the standard language of the web, which is HTTP. It provides a set of actions (called methods) you can perform, like: -> GET : Asking to see something. -> POST : Sending new information to be created. -> PUT : Sending updates to existing information, PUT usually replaces the whole thing. -> PATCH: Sending updates to existing information, PATCH updates part of it. -> DELETE: Asking to remove something. Dealing with Changes Over Time: Versioning As an API gets better or needs to change, the developers might create different versions so that older apps that were built to use the old way still work. You might see this in the web address (like /api/v1/users) or in some other technical details. Keeping Things Separate: Sub-domain For bigger projects, the API might live under its own web address, like api.yourwebsite.com . This helps keep it separate from the main website and makes things cleaner. Where to Find Things: Endpoint An endpoint is just a specific web address where you can find a particular 'thing' or a collection of 'things' in the API. For example, /users might be the endpoint for managing users, and /products/{id} might be for a specific product. Using the Right Actions: HTTP Method As mentioned before, using the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) is crucial for telling the server exactly what you want to do with the resource at a specific endpoint. Getting Only What You Need: Filtering Instead of getting a massive list of everything, you can often use filtering to ask for only the specific data you're interested in. You usually do this by adding extra bits to the web address (like /users?status=active). Handling Lots of Stuff: Pagination When you're dealing with tons of data (like thousands of products), sending it all at once would be slow and overwhelming. Pagination breaks the data into smaller chunks (pages) so your app can request and show it piece by piece. You'll often see things like /products?page=2&limit=50 in the web address. So, there you have it – the core ideas behind REST APIs , from the fundamental principles to the practical bits and pieces. It's all about creating a clear, organized, and efficient way for different digital systems to communicate. Understanding these concepts will not only make you a better developer but also give you a deeper appreciation for how the interconnected world works.Hope this breakdown was helpful!

jingjing-zhong,"As I near the end of my tenure at Helpling Singapore, I am filled with a range of emotions. In these incredible four and half years, I got numerous opportunities to learn and grow both personally and professionally. Today, I’ll share 6 key lessons that shaped me into a better business partner, manager, and person — and I hope they will be helpful to you as well. 1. You are a “Work In Progress” After a year or two at your job, you kind of know it inside out. However, the truth is there’s always room for improvement and you should push yourself out of your comfort zones to become 1% better each day. And one of the best ways to achieve that is by improving your self-awareness. I’ve noticed that self-awareness is essential for any manager. It allows you to better understand yourself and how you interact with others, and it makes it easier for you to work with your team effectively. 2. Networking Leads to Personal and Career Growth Some young professionals may not see the value in networking, but building genuine connections pays off in the long run. With time, I realized that networking is also about building mutually beneficial relationships and helping others succeed, so be helpful to people around you when you can. 3. What’s Your Leverage? Find It and Double It Down! I believe everyone is replaceable, but having a leverage makes it harder to be replaced. So it’s crucial to know it, and use it to your/ your company’s advantage. For me, building relationships with people has been my forte. And I was able to demonstrate my value to the Company by using it to facilitate company growth. Read how to find your strength here . 4. Hire For Common Sense and Attitude When it comes to hiring, a lot of managers look at GPA, experience or what degree the person has. However, I have seen hiring success using a different approach. I believe if a person has the right attitude (i.e. someone curious, eager to improve and who feels grateful about the job etc.), they can learn whatever is required of him/her. Which is why I prioritize common sense and attitude over aptitude and skill sets. While the latter can be taught, the former can’t. 5. Play to Win Throughout these years, I’ve noticed some folks would not give things a chance if they knew that it might fail. It's important to approach challenges with a ""play to win"" mentality rather than a ""play not to lose"" attitude. Dream big and take calculated risks. 6. Managing Stress and Emotional Breakdowns Let’s face it. We human beings are not invincible to the ups and downs. While most meditation practice focuses on managing surface level symptoms, ie fear, anxiety, stress and mood swings. I think what it really teaches us is to be present. Being aware that we tend to have cravings and aversions, we can slowly get out of self-created miseries. Meditation has repeatedly proven to be a valuable tool for me. To start this journey, set an intention to practice meditation and commit to it, the benefits are truly transformative. Moving Forward As I started preparing to leave, I researched ways of proper handover. I decided to follow Ray Dailo’s advice to put a system in place for the next person, as I know this match making process might take awhile. Although I've been questioned about my choice, why would I put in so much effort to do this handover, my answer is, why not? There's a reason why “Mars and Venus on a Date” stressed not breaking up on a bad note, and I believe this theory applies in career transitions too. With a strong will to close this chapter on a high note, I've made an effort to properly thank all of the partners and colleagues who have supported me and Helpling during the last 4.5 years. (Thanks to a friend who suggested this to me) The love, celebration, and gratefulness I've received in return have been overwhelming and truly heartwarming. I am deeply grateful to Helpling for all that it has offered me, and I wish the company the best of luck in the future.

shivanivirdi,"Cursor just published how they actually use their own agent internally. 8 practices I wish I knew 6 months ago These are the practices that separate using Cursor from actually getting results with it. 1. Plan Before Code ↳ Press Shift+Tab. ↳ Agent researches your codebase first. ↳ Asks clarifying questions. ↳ Creates a detailed plan with file paths and references. ↳ You approve before it writes anything. ↳ Plans save as editable Markdown. ↳ When output goes wrong, revert and refine the plan. 2. Rules vs Skills ↳ Rules (.cursor/rules/): always-on project context. ↳ Commands to run, patterns to follow, pointers to canonical files. ↳ Reference files instead of copying contents. They go stale otherwise. ↳ Skills ( SKILL.md ): load dynamically when the agent decides they're relevant. ↳ Custom commands, hooks, domain knowledge. ↳ Context window stays clean. ↳ Start simple. Add rules only when you notice repeated mistakes. 3. Hooks for Self-Correcting Loops ↳ Configure a hook that runs every time the agent stops. ↳ It checks a scratchpad file. ↳ Goal not met? Sends a follow-up and the agent continues. ↳ Cap it at N iterations. ↳ Goes from ""one pass and done"" to ""iterate until tests pass."" ↳ Same pattern works for matching UI to a mockup. 4. TDD with Agents ↳ Write tests first. Confirm they fail. ↳ Then let the agent implement. ↳ Explicitly tell it not to touch the tests. ↳ Agents perform best with a clear target to iterate against. ↳ Without tests, they have no signal for whether their code works. 5. Parallel Agents with Worktrees ↳ Cursor creates isolated git worktrees per agent. ↳ Each agent edits, builds, and tests independently. ↳ No file conflicts. Click Apply to merge back. ↳ Run the same prompt across multiple models simultaneously. ↳ Compare results side by side. ↳ Best for hard problems where models take different approaches. 6. Debug Mode ↳ Standard agent interaction guesses at fixes. Debug Mode doesn't. ↳ Generates multiple hypotheses. ↳ Instruments your code with logging. ↳ Asks you to reproduce the bug while collecting data. ↳ Then makes targeted fixes based on evidence. ↳ Systematic, not guess-and-patch. ↳ Best for race conditions, timing issues, and regressions. 7. Context Discipline ↳ Switch conversation when switching tasks/ agent repeats mistakes. ↳ Long conversations accumulate noise. ↳ Stop tagging every file manually. ↳ Agent has grep and semantic search. It finds what it needs. ↳ Use @Branch to orient it to current work. ↳ Use @Past Chats to pull earlier context cleanly. 8. Cloud Agents ↳ Describe the task. Agent clones your repo. ↳ Creates a branch.

baptiste-parravicini,"Big Story: Debugging in an AI-Generated Integration World Key Takeaways AI-assisted coding increases API integration speed while reducing visibility into underlying assumptions. Debugging moves from reading the code to understanding how API interactions actually behave across systems. Observability, contract clarity, and ownership become primary safeguards in automated API environments. AI-assisted development has changed how API integrations are created. Code that once required careful reading of API documentation, deliberate implementation, and peer review can now be generated in seconds. When a developer writes integration logic manually, they internalize the API contracts they are working with. They understand why a retry exists, why a transformation is needed to match a schema, or why a fallback call to another endpoint was added. When integration code is generated by an AI system, those decisions are often implicit. The code may successfully call the API and return valid responses, but the assumptions about rate limits, idempotency, pagination, or error semantics are rarely examined in depth. This changes debugging. Failures no longer present as simple implementation errors. They appear as behavioral mismatches across services connected through APIs. The challenge is that the design rationale behind how the API was consumed is undocumented. In traditional workflows, debugging begins by reviewing recent code changes and matching them against API documentation. In an AI-assisted workflow, prompts evolve, context windows shift, and regeneration alters structure without explicit explanation. Observability at the API layer becomes foundational. Structured logs, distributed traces, and explicit correlation identifiers are necessary to reconstruct execution paths across internal and external APIs. Telemetry must capture not only request and response metadata but also contextual signals such as retries, conditional branches, token usage, and downstream dependency calls. Ownership clarity becomes equally important. As AI tools generate more API integrations, it must be clear which team owns each API dependency and its lifecycle. Another emerging consideration is reproducibility. When integration logic that consumes APIs is generated through prompts, reproducing the exact conditions under which it was created can be difficult. Teams are beginning to store prompt artifacts alongside integration code, treating them as part of the implementation record. Testing strategies also evolve. Behavioral drift across chained API calls requires scenario-based testing and contract validation. In an environment where machines generate integration code, debugging becomes an exercise in reconstructing API intent from observable behavior. Systems must be instrumented in ways that make that reconstruction feasible. API Feed CX Today reported that a misconfigured backend in the AI-agent social network Moltbook exposed sensitive data, including API authentication tokens, private messages, and user email addresses, enabling unauthorized access to the production database. The incident illustrates how fast-built, API-driven products can ship without secure defaults, and why token handling, row-level access controls, and configuration review need to be treated as part of the API security measures.

This enables event-driven architectures for Chat integrations that can run behind firewalls, and it pushes teams toward more standardized message ingestion and operational controls for internal automation. ( Reference ) Community Spotlight Kin Lane: Treating APIs as Organizational Memory Kin Lane has spent more than a decade mapping the API landscape as an independent analyst documenting how APIs are actually designed, governed, and maintained. Through his long-running work at API Evangelist, Lane has catalogued patterns across industries, highlighting where APIs succeed, where they decay, and where governance quietly breaks down. He focuses on the lifecycle of APIs inside organizations, from early experimentation to version sprawl and documentation drift. His work repeatedly shows that most API problems are not technical edge cases but organizational ones. As automation and AI-driven systems increase the number of integrations inside enterprises, Laneʼs framing becomes more relevant. More endpoints mean more surface area. More surface area means more potential for inconsistency and blind spots. Lane also highlights the importance of transparency in API ecosystems. He often argues that governance should be visible and measurable. In large organizations, internal APIs can proliferate faster than they are documented. Without inventory and oversight, automation can interact with systems that were never hardened for sustained use. What makes Laneʼs work stand out is its continuity. He has tracked API evolution across cycles of hype and consolidation, consistently returning to the fundamentals of design clarity, documentation integrity, and lifecycle stewardship. As APIs become execution backbones for increasingly autonomous systems, his long-term view reinforces a simple idea that organizations that understand and map their API footprint are better positioned to scale safely. He also brings a pragmatic lens to API tooling and standards conversations. Rather than focusing only on new specifications or platform features, Lane consistently asks how they will be adopted, maintained, and governed over time. His work connects design decisions to operational consequences, reminding teams that every endpoint added today becomes part of tomorrowʼs institutional complexity. In a landscape where integration speed is increasing, his emphasis on intentional API design and long-term stewardship offers a counterbalance that many organizations overlook.

reidhoffman,"This week, Parth and I discussed what it actually takes to become ""AI native"" as a startup — and why many teams are learning slower than necessary because they're treating AI adoption like a features checklist rather than a fundamental shift in how they operate. Parth’s workflow and mindset is indicative of someone who has restructured their life and work around AI capabilities. He lives inside the possibility space of what these systems currently enable and could become. I remember thinking: ""This is what being AI-pilled looks like."" Parth’s learnings aren’t just for individuals. They're replicable strategies that can accelerate how quickly an entrepreneur or small startup team becomes AI-fluent. Build tools, don't search for them. AI-native teams build custom solutions for specific problems rather than searching for SaaS products that somewhat fit. Most people ask ""what tool exists for this?"" AI-native thinkers ask ""what would the perfect solution look like for my exact situation?"" Then they build it, even if crude. Identify friction points specific to your team and build lightweight AI solutions. A tool that converts Slack discussions into structured feature requests. A system that pre-analyzes support tickets and routes them with context. An agent that monitors competitor updates and synthesizes what matters for your roadmap. Stop waiting for the perfect product. Build the minimum viable solution for your specific problem today. As Parth realized when language models became available: ""There's no excuse. It's never been easier to wield the power of code."" That's even more true now. 15 people with AI can compete with 150 without it AI fundamentally changes what small teams can accomplish. The traditional scaling problem: as you grow, coordination costs compound, requiring more headcount. Small teams avoid this tax but can hit a ceiling on capability. AI breaks this equation. The coordination overhead that used to require more people — meeting notes, decision documentation, status tracking, context sharing — can now be handled by AI systems your existing team configures. Small teams move faster here because they have less organizational debt to work around. The advantage goes deeper. Small teams have clearer shared context, something large organizations can't replicate. AI amplifies this because you can build systems that capture and surface patterns across that shared context. Make AI adoption a ritual The biggest mistake startups make is treating AI adoption like rolling out new software. Instead, develop a culture of experimentation and conversation about how employees use AI to supercharge their work. Rituals matter—like sharing an experiment in Slack each day. The software rollout approach fails because AI tools don't work like traditional software with plug-and-play outcomes. AI is a reasoning partner, not a deterministic system. The same prompt that generates genius output for one workflow produces mediocrity for another. The real unlock: when your designer mentions using AI to generate twenty microcopy variations in five minutes, your PM immediately asks ""wait, could that work for user stories?"" The insight spreads organically, gets adapted, evolves. This is part three of my series with Parth, who was the first data scientist at Clubhouse, the co-creator of my digital twin Reid AI, and an advisor to companies on AI products and strategy.

doravanourek,"A year ago, I left my 25+ years tech consulting career. To build something of my own. My friends couldn't understand why I'd leave stability. Others questioned if it was ""too late"" to start over. A few called it a midlife crisis. But then I found my new people. Entrepreneurs who'd walked away from golden handcuffs. Creators building empires from their expertise. Leaders who measured success differently. Their ambition didn't make me feel behind. It showed me what was possible. When you change your path, you need people who've already taken the leap. 5 ways to upgrade your circle: 1. Audit your conversations - are you talking about problems or possibilities? 2. Join spaces where your future self would hang out, not where you currently are. 3. Share your bold goals openly - ambitious people are drawn to other dreamers. 4.

travisbradberry,"For many of us, 2026 begins with a promise—a promise that this year we will accomplish that which has eluded us. Often it’s the everyday things that prove most difficult—managing your schedule, treating people the way you ought to, and keeping things in perspective when chaos is at hand. The sad truth is that nearly 80% of us will fall off the resolution bandwagon by Super Bowl Sunday; and by this time next year, a mere 5% of us will have succeeded in reaching our goals. There are two reasons why we’re so bad at reaching our goals: The first is that we bite off more than we can chew. It may seem reasonable to pick up three or four new skills to add to your repertoire, but that’s an expectation the mind can’t execute. When we try to develop too many new skills at once, they become competing priorities that leave us distracted, discouraged and overwhelmed. The second reason most self-improvement efforts are doomed to fail is that our emotions have a nasty habit of hijacking our behavior. Without a strong ability to recognize and manage our emotions as they occur, old habits are sure to die hard. The Good News The good news is that you can address both problems and make the changes you desire by resolving this year to develop a single skill—emotional intelligence (EQ). Piles of research over the last two decades has shown that emotional intelligence is likely the single most powerful success factor yet discovered, affecting everything from your performance at work, to your mood and the quality of your personal life. I’ve tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other critical skills and found that it subsumes the majority of them. It’s no wonder that 92% of top performers are high in EQ and people with high EQs make $37,000 more annually than their low EQ counterparts. But how does emotional intelligence play such a large role in so many important skills? Our brains are wired such that emotions are the root of all human behavior. Whether we’re aware of it or not, the motivation behind every action (no matter how small) is inherently emotional. Here's how it works: All of your primary senses enter at the base of your brain. Before you can think rationally about what you're experiencing, these signals must travel through the limbic system—the place where emotions are generated. This ensures you have an emotional reaction to events first. Emotional intelligence ensures effective communication between the rational and emotional centers of your brain. As you improve your emotional intelligence, you improve your ability to understand and control the primary motivations for your behavior, which reaps dividends in everything you do every day. Emotional intelligence is powerful and efficient—it allows you to focus your energy on a single skill with tremendous results. What Does Emotional Intelligence Look Like? Emotional intelligence is the “something” in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Emotional intelligence is made up of four core skills that pair up under two primary competencies: personal competence and social competence. Personal competence comprises your self-awareness and self-management skills, which focus more on you individually than on your interactions with other people. Personal competence is your ability to stay aware of your emotions and manage your behavior and tendencies. Self-Awareness is your ability to accurately perceive your emotions and stay aware of them as they happen. Self-Management is your ability to use awareness of your emotions to stay flexible and positively direct your behavior. Social competence is made up of your social awareness and relationship management skills; social competence is your ability to understand other people’s moods, behavior, and motives in order to respond effectively and improve the quality of your relationships. Social Awareness is your ability to accurately pick up on emotions in other people and understand what is really going on. Relationship Management is your ability to use awareness of your emotions and the others’ emotions to manage interactions successfully. While working on your emotional intelligence will improve a lot of different skills, there are five in particular that people tend to set goals around when the year changes. I'll explain how you can improve each of these skills solely by focusing on your emotional intelligence. Time Management In this age of abundance, time is the one thing nobody has enough of. Perhaps that’s why Google receives 111 million searches a month for Time Management. Few people recognize how time management depends upon the emotional intelligence skills of self-management and relationship management. Creating a good schedule is a very rational thing, but sticking to that schedule is decidedly emotional. Many of us start out every day with the best intentions to manage our time wisely. But then we receive a complicated email from a co-worker, a consuming phone call from a friend, or otherwise get sidetracked until our well-laid plans go up in flames. We spend the rest of the day trying to put out somebody else’s fire, or working to resolve issues that weren’t there in the morning. Before you know it, the day is gone and you’re completely off schedule. When the distractions are your own, sticking to a schedule requires self-management. When the needs of others try to impede upon your plans, it takes effective relationship management to finesse the relationship while ensuring that your priorities are still addressed. Embracing Change Show me somebody who claims to love change, and I’ll show you a well-intentioned liar. Change is uncomfortable for everyone at times, and for many of us it makes our skin crawl. Those who apply well-honed self-awareness and self-management skills tolerate change much more successfully than others. Self-awareness enables you to adjust comfortably to change because it gives you the perspective needed to realize when change is coming and how it's affecting you. Self-management keeps you cool in the moment—often with a reminder that even the most stable, trusted facets of your life are not completely under your control. Those most averse to change, who possess great self-awareness and self-management skills, even set aside a small amount of time each week to list possible changes and what actions they can take in response. Assertiveness Emotional intelligence is commonly mistaken as a synonym for “nice.” In fact, the most emotionally intelligent response is often one where you openly and directly express yourself. To paraphrase Aristotle, getting angry is easy. Getting angry with the right person, at the right time, and to the right degree requires emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence doesn’t allow lashing out, or making yourself into someone else’s doormat. To be assertive, you have to know what you’re feeling, read the other party accurately, and express yourself in a way that garners the best result. People with high EQs do this naturally. Making Great Decisions It has taken the world far too long to wake up to the fact that emotions simply cannot—and should not—be ignored when making decisions. Neuroscience shows us that sometimes the most rational thing you can do is trust your emotions when making a decision. But in order to make this work, you have to be aware of the emotions you’re feeling, know why you’re having them, and see how they factor into the situation at hand. Here, there is no substitute for emotional intelligence. Giving Outstanding Presentations Few things strike primal fear in people like standing under the spotlight in a room full of people. Even the most eloquent among us can be reduced to spewing verbal garbage once the sheer anxiety of public speaking takes hold. That’s why a knock-’em-dead presenter’s most inspiring presentation is often the one he delivers to himself. A bit of positive self-talk—reminding himself of all the times he has succeeded and how qualified he is to speak on the topic—enables the effective speaker to use his performance anxiety to sharpen his focus and make him more articulate. If you think that’s silly, then you probably haven’t tried it. Emotional intelligence doesn’t just make you aware of your emotions; it equips you with strategies for keeping them from holding you back.

it equips you with strategies for keeping them from holding you back. moving forward give improving your emotional intelligence a real shot in 2026. you'll be surprised where it takes you. you'll have some extra help this year from my new book more on that below. how will you reach your goals this year? please share your thoughts in the comments section, as i learn just as much from you as you do from me. if you enjoyed this article, click the subscribe button below and you'll receive a new one just like it each week. about the author: dr. travis bradberry is the award-winning author of the #1 bestselling book, the new emotional intelligence . dr. bradberry is the world's #1 emotional intelligence author, having sold more than 5 million books. he has written for, or been covered by, time, usa today, the wall street journal, bloomberg businessweek, fortune, forbes, fast company, and the harvard business review. if you'd like to learn how to increase your eq, consider taking the test that's included via unique passcode in the new emotional intelligence book. your test results will reveal which of the book's 60 strategies will increase your eq the most.",-15,too_long,"for many of us, 2026 begins with a promisea promise that this year we will accomplish that which has eluded us",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,5,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,66

If your team can’t function without you, you’re not leading; you’re babysitting. “Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.” — Sheryl Sandberg As you sharpen your leadership skills, keep these 3 things in mind: 1. Leadership is about subtraction, not control. Notice how many rules remove friction (fewer meetings, less micromanagement, swift handling of toxicity). Effective leadership is often about what you stop doing, not what you add. 2. The list quietly prioritizes energy management over time management. Deep work, time off, and focus on high-impact tasks all point to the same truth: burned-out teams don’t scale impact—recovered teams do. 3. “Presence vs. absence” is the real scorecard. Anyone can lead loudly when they’re in the room. These laws optimize for something harder: does the team still make good decisions when you’re not there? That’s the difference between authority and leadership. Now read it one more time with these insights in mind... 11 Laws of Effective Leadership Lead yourself before you lead others. Hire great people, then get out of their way. Be ready to dive in when needed. Communicate clearly, consistently, and often. Gather input, make decisions, then take action.

niharika-gupta-8bb47882,"My Journey into the World of AI Agents The field of AI is constantly evolving, and one of the most exciting developments is the rise of AI agents. These are not just passive tools that respond to our queries, but active participants that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks. My recent dive into this topic has been eye-opening, and I want to share some of my key learnings. The Foundation: Prompt Engineering At the heart of any AI agent lies the Large Language Model (LLM), a powerful engine trained on vast amounts of text. The key to unlocking its potential is prompt engineering . A prompt is more than just a question; it's a carefully crafted instruction that guides the LLM's response. There are different techniques for this. A zero-shot prompt asks the model to perform a task it hasn't been explicitly trained on, relying on its general knowledge. A few-shot prompt, on the other hand, gives the model a few examples to learn from, which can significantly improve its accuracy and guide the model towards a desired output format.. Building an Agentic System For those looking to build their own AI agents, there's a growing ecosystem of frameworks available, including Microsoft's Autogen , Hugging Face's smol-agents , etc. These tools provide the building blocks for creating sophisticated multi-agent systems. I decided to work with Microsoft's AutoGen ( github ) framework and set up a simple chat between two stand-up comedian agents, ""Cathy"" and ""Joe."" They were programmed to tell jokes by building on each other's punchlines, demonstrating how ConversableAgents can maintain context in a conversation. I used Code Llama model which is freely available from Ollama and is open source. Here are the steps: Get the local model from Ollama: ollama pull codellama Install pyautogen: pip install pyautogen Configure the agents in a Python script: from autogen import ConversableAgent # Configure the local LLM model llm_config = { ""model"": ""codellama"", ""base_url"": ""http://localhost:11434/v1"", ""api_key"": ""ollama"", # Required by the API but can be any string } # Setup the first agent: Cathy cathy = ConversableAgent( name=""cathy"", system_message=""Your name is Cathy and you are a stand-up comedian."", llm_config=llm_config, human_input_mode=""NEVER"", ) # Setup the second agent: Joe joe = ConversableAgent( name=""joe"", system_message=""Your name is Joe and you are a stand-up comedian.

reidhoffman,"We’re all becoming gamers. We’re quickly moving towards a world where, with AI, we’ll all be able to craft tools to help us better play the game of life. For those who grew up playing video games, you understand what I mean. It should help you turn ideas into real things, instantly get unstuck on hard problems, and operate beyond what one person could normally do alone. Nowhere is this more true than in AI-development platforms like Replit. At scale, these platforms will make life start to feel like you’re progressing through a game: each new challenge is a level, and AI is how you craft a way forward. For centuries, humans have built tools to get ahead—sometimes individually, sometimes together. But as economies matured, most of us stopped building tools and started relying on the ones already available to work faster, live better, or scale what we were doing. Software took this trend to its extreme. Most people don’t use software that’s designed for them. They use general-purpose tools built for the median user, tools that improve generic workflows, but rarely map cleanly onto the specific problems any one person is actually trying to solve. That tradeoff made sense, as generalized software could scale to help more people and generate more revenue. For the user, though, it created a paradigm where a specific tool to solve a specific problem was hard to find, so you either had to patch a bunch of consumer software together (annoying), learn to code (time consuming) or could convince someone else to do it for you (often expensive). With Replit, that paradigm has been shattered. Now, building software is easy, and almost feels like you’re playing a game, trying to craft the perfect tool to beat the level that’s been stumping you for weeks. A useful analogy here is Minecraft. Minecraft doesn’t give you a finished solution or a prescribed path. It gives you a world, a set of primitives, and fast feedback. If you need a tool, you build it. If the tool isn’t right, you can try another way. You don’t wait for a perfect object to exist—you craft what you need from what’s available. Replit increasingly feels like that kind of environment for software. And that’s exactly what Replit was designed to feel like; after all, Amjad Masad has spoken openly about how deeply video games shaped his thinking. Games understand something important about motivation: early wins matter. You need to feel agency quickly. When Amjad talks about tools that let you “make something immediately,” he’s describing the same psychological hook that games rely on. You don’t need mastery at the beginning. You need evidence that your actions matter and that you can keep building. There’s also something important about the authorship over the tools you build in Replit. One reason games are satisfying is that they give you a clear sense that you caused something to happen. When someone builds a small tool that helps their own life (or their family, or their business) they see the full loop. Even if the result is modest, it compounds over time as you build bigger and more impressive things. Right now, a small fraction of the world is using Replit to build tools for themselves. But in a few years, we’ll shift from thinking “what can I buy to help me” to “what can I build to help me.” Work and life will feel like progressing through levels, where each new challenge is met not by waiting for the right software to exist, but by creating it. The real change isn’t that everyone becomes a programmer; it’s that everyone gains the ability to shape their environment, extend their capabilities, and move forward under their own control. The real change is everyone becomes a gamer—building for the most important game they’ll play.

alexchriss,"For many entrepreneurial individuals, the change of the calendar year presents the helpful push needed to launch a new business. If you’re thinking about starting a small business in 2018, you aren’t alone. In fact, an estimated 42 million small businesses will be in operation in the U.S. by 2026. As you formulate a plan, it’s important to keep tabs on the macro trends that could impact your new business. Here are five major trends that I believe will have the biggest impact on the small business landscape in 2018 – and beyond. 1. Artificial Intelligence is a Friend, not a Foe While previously viewed as territory best left to the tech titans with vast amounts of customer data, artificial intelligence is now accessible to even the smallest of businesses through third-party tools. In 2018, more small business owners will embrace AI as an important competitive tool, using it to automate mundane administrative tasks, unlock customer insights, and much more . Opinions are already looking up: A new study prepared by Intuit and Emergent Research found that half of small business owners are enthusiastic about automation technology, and of those, 87 percent believe it will have a positive impact on their business over the next five years. As you develop your business plan, consider not only how to incorporate third-party tools into your business strategy, but also how to market your business in an AI-driven world. 2. Fluid Workforces on the Rise The rapid rise of the contingent workforce of freelancers and other on-demand talent is making a big splash in the small business world. Increasingly, small business owners are turning to on-demand workers instead of hiring full-time employees to handle project needs because of the incredible flexibility it affords. Businesses can easily scale up or down based on demand. Moreover, a variety of tech tools and platforms has made finding and hiring these workers painlessly simple. Today, 42 percent of employer small businesses already use contract workers, and you can expect this number rise in 2018. If you’re interested in scaling your business with fluid workers, browse a variety of talent marketplaces like UpWork and Wonolo to find the right platform for your business needs. 3. Niche Markets Rule Consumer interests and appetites have long been marching away from the mainstream and directly into fine-tuned niche markets. Millennials in particular, with $200 billion in annual buying power, are passionate about their niche brands, driving the growth of things like microbrew beer and artisan coffee over the big names that have dominated for decades. In 2018, small businesses will continue to find themselves uniquely positioned to take advantage of these specialty markets. With lower operating costs, access to internet tools like Amazon and Etsy’s marketplaces, and deep customer knowledge, small business owners will find it much easier than their big business rivals to serve niche markets. The key: Identify your niche, and hone it with precision. 4. Digital Payments Our transition to becoming a cashless society has been underway for decades, with smartphone-based payment systems only hastening the trend that started with credit cards in the 1960s. There’s no slowing down: from 2012 to 2015, the number of non-cash payments increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent . Going cashless is great for small business. It streamlines bookkeeping, creates a safer business environment, and gives customers more payment options. It’s how customers want to pay. Fortunately, cashless payments are getting easier. From Apple Pay to Square to QuickBooks GoPayment , you now have a plethora of options if you want to explore digital transactions. And you should: Come 2018, more customers than ever will expect digital payment options from businesses of all sizes. 5. An Increase in Crisis Preparation From Hurricane Harvey, to the California wildfires, the natural disasters of 2017 were a wake-up call to many who were unprepared for Mother Nature’s wrath. An estimated 25 percent of businesses never reopen again after a major disaster, and more than half of small business owners say they aren’t prepared for the data loss associated with a disaster. I believe this heightened awareness will encourage more small business owners to prioritize crisis preparation in 2018. To get started, check out The Small Business Administration’s disaster checklists and tips – an essential toolkit for diligent small business owners as they prepare for the worst in the year ahead. Looking Ahead Some business trends may be loose and ephemeral, but these five are here for the long haul, and are sure to have a significant impact on your business in 2018. Don’t wait for the need to arise – start shaping your own unique strategies around them today, and you’ll be sure to beat your competition to the punch.

firmin-zocchetto,"2 000 personnes à l’AI Day de France Digitale . Une belle mobilisation et un sacré succès pour partager autour du développement fulgurant de cette nouvelle technologie. L'IA n'est plus une promesse, c’est désormais une réalité dans de nombreux business, une couche structurelle de notre économie. A STATION F hier, j'ai pu constater l’importance de l'écosystème français, déjà très concret : des centaines de startups et de scaleups, des milliers d’emplois, et des usages qui irriguent désormais tous les secteurs, bien au-delà de la seule tech 🇫🇷🇪🇺 On n’est plus dans l’expérimentation. On est dans une phase d’industrialisation. La vraie question devient : comment l’insérer dans le travail réel, dans les organisations, dans les métiers, dans les chaînes de décision. C’est d’ailleurs ce qui est ressorti de nos discussions avec Lucie Finet , Benjamin Deplus et Emilie Pierre-Desmonde , mais aussi de mes échanges avec les responsables politiques notamment avec le Ministre du Travail, Jean-Pierre Farandou . L’enjeu n’est pas seulement l’innovation, mais les conditions de son déploiement : la clarté du cadre, le traitement des données, la confiance et surtout la capacité des entreprises à transformer rapidement mais sans désorganiser. Chez PayFit , c’est exactement le sujet sur lequel on travaille depuis plusieurs années. Réussir à intégrer l’IA là où elle améliore concrètement le travail, la qualité, la lisibilité, pour nos équipes comme pour nos clients. Et avec notre outil IA PayFit Copilot, on voit une chose très claire : quand l’IA est utilisée de la bonne manière, l’adoption suit. Aujourd’hui, près de 90% des admins l’utilisent au quotidien !

travisbradberry,"If you’re like most people, you spend more of your valuable waking hours at work than you do anywhere else. It’s critical that you spend your time at the right company, pursuing the right opportunity. Bad management does not discriminate based on salary or job title. A Fortune 500 executive team can experience more dissatisfaction and turnover than the baristas at a local coffee shop. The more demanding your job is and the less control you have over what you do, the more likely you are to suffer. A study by the American Psychological Association found that people whose work meets both these criteria are more likely to experience exhaustion, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression. Staying in a bad job for too long can be very harmful to your career. If you’ve tried everything you can think of to make things better and haven’t seen any big changes, it may be time to move on. Choosing to leave a job can be a gut-wrenching decision. You need to know that you’re making the right choice. The good news is there are some clear signs that—if you experience enough of them—suggest it's time to move on. The company is circling the drain. A study showed that 71 percent of small businesses close their doors by their tenth year in operation. If you’re worried about your company’s health, there’s a good chance you’re right. Watch for clues, like suddenly needing management approval for even minor expenses, an increase in closed-door meetings, or an increased number of upper-management departures. If you suspect that the business is in trouble, it may be time to leave. If you wait until the company closes, you’ll be in the job market competing against your former co-workers. There’s no room for advancement. It’s easy to get stuck in a job and, if you love what you’re doing, getting stuck can be comfortable. However, it’s important to remember that every job should enhance your skills, and add to your value as an employee. If you’re not learning anything new, and are just puttering around doing the same old thing while people around you get promotions and plum assignments, it’s time to look elsewhere. You’re out of the loop. Does it seem like you’re always the last one to hear about what’s going on at work? If you’re left out of meetings, rarely get face time with upper management, and have never even heard of the big project everyone else is so excited about, that could mean that your bosses just see you as a body filling a desk, rather than as a valuable contributor. That’s bad news for your career and may mean it’s time to leave. You know more than your boss. It’s frustrating to work for someone you believe to be less skilled or knowledgeable than you are, but the real issue is deeper than that. If you can’t trust your company’s leadership to make good decisions and steer the ship in the right direction, you’ll be living in a constant state of anxiety. And, if you’re right that your bosses don’t know what they’re doing, you could find yourself out of a job when the company goes under. You have a bad boss who isn’t going anywhere. Bosses come and go, which is why conventional wisdom says that it’s best to just wait a bad boss out. But that’s not always the right move. If you have a bad boss who’s well-liked by upper management, it may be time to leave. In addition to making you miserable every day, a two-faced manager who’s loved by the higher ups can wreak havoc on your career by taking credit for your work, bad-mouthing you to others, and blaming you for things that go wrong. You dread going to work. We all get a case of the Mondays from time to time, but if even thinking about your job fills you with dread, it’s probably time to leave. Don’t keep telling yourself you’re having a bad week if what you really have is a job that’s a bad fit. Toxic personalities get to stick around. You can tell a lot about a company by seeing who is protected. When those who constantly stir the pot and create a toxic environment are allowed to stick around, that's a huge red flag. You’ve lost your passion. Even if you love the company, your boss, and your co-workers, it’s not worth the effort if you hate the work. Passion is a necessary ingredient for success. If you’re unenthusiastic or even indifferent about the work you do, it’s time to reassess your career. Your health is suffering. No paycheck is worth sacrificing your health. Job stress can lead to depression, insomnia, headaches, frequent illness, and worse. Don’t let this happen to you. Your personal life is suffering. Whether you work too many hours or you’re stressed and miserable when you come home, it’s time to leave when your job starts affecting your personal life. Moving Forward If you do decide to leave, be smart about it. Don’t burn bridges by venting about all of the reasons you’re leaving. That accomplishes nothing, and could even haunt you later. Instead, simply explain that you’re leaving to pursue another opportunity, and then do so graciously.

travisbradberry,"When emotional intelligence first appeared to the masses, it served as the missing link in a peculiar finding: people with average IQs outperform those with the highest IQs 70% of the time. This anomaly threw a massive wrench into what many people had always assumed was the sole source of success—IQ. Decades of research now point to emotional intelligence as the critical factor that sets star performers apart from the rest of the pack. Emotional intelligence is the “something” in each of us that is a bit intangible. It affects how we manage behavior, navigate social complexities, and make personal decisions that achieve positive results. Emotional intelligence is made up of four core skills that pair up under two primary competencies: personal competence and social competence. Personal competence comprises your self-awareness and self-management skills, which focus more on you individually than on your interactions with other people. Personal competence is your ability to stay aware of your emotions and manage your behavior and tendencies. Self-Awareness is your ability to accurately perceive your emotions and stay aware of them as they happen. Self-Management is your ability to use awareness of your emotions to stay flexible and positively direct your behavior. Social competence is made up of your social awareness and relationship management skills; social competence is your ability to understand other people’s moods, behavior, and motives in order to respond effectively and improve the quality of your relationships. Social Awareness is your ability to accurately pick up on emotions in other people and understand what is really going on. Relationship Management is your ability to use awareness of your emotions and the others’ emotions to manage interactions successfully. Emotional Intelligence, IQ, and Personality Are Different Emotional intelligence taps into a fundamental element of human behavior that is distinct from your intellect. There is no known connection between IQ and emotional intelligence; you simply can’t predict emotional intelligence based on how smart someone is. Intelligence is your ability to learn, and it’s the same at age 15 as it is at age 50. Emotional intelligence, on the other hand, is a flexible set of skills that can be acquired and improved with practice. Although some people are naturally more emotionally intelligent than others, you can develop high emotional intelligence even if you aren’t born with it. Personality is the final piece of the puzzle. It’s the stable “style” that defines each of us. Personality is the result of hard-wired preferences, such as the inclination toward introversion or extroversion. However, like IQ, personality can’t be used to predict emotional intelligence. Also like IQ, personality is stable over a lifetime and doesn’t change. IQ, emotional intelligence, and personality each cover unique ground and help to explain what makes a person tick. Emotional Intelligence Predicts Performance How much of an impact does emotional intelligence have on your professional success? The short answer is: a lot! It’s a powerful way to focus your energy in one direction with a tremendous result. In preparing my new book , I tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other important workplace skills, and found that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance, explaining roughly 60% of success in all types of jobs. Your emotional intelligence is the foundation for a host of critical skills—it impacts most everything you do and say each day. Of all the people I’ve studied at work, I've found that 90% of top performers are also high in emotional intelligence. On the flip side, just 20% of bottom performers are high in emotional intelligence. You can be a top performer without emotional intelligence, but the chances are slim. Naturally, people with a high degree of emotional intelligence make more money—an average of $37,000 more per year than people with a low degree of emotional intelligence. The link between emotional intelligence and earnings is so direct that every point increase in emotional intelligence adds $1,700 to an annual salary. These findings hold true for people in all industries, at all levels, in every region of the world. I haven’t yet been able to find a job in which performance and pay aren’t tied closely to emotional intelligence. You Can Increase Your Emotional Intelligence The communication between your emotional and rational “brains” is the physical source of emotional intelligence. The pathway for emotional intelligence starts in the brain, at the spinal cord. Your primary senses enter here and must travel to the front of your brain before you can think rationally about your experience. However, first they travel through the limbic system, the place where emotions are generated. So, we have an emotional reaction to events before our rational mind is able to engage. Emotional intelligence requires effective communication between the rational and emotional centers of the brain. Plasticity is the term neurologists use to describe the brain’s ability to change. As you discover and practice new emotional intelligence skills, the billions of microscopic neurons lining the road between the rational and emotional centers of your brain branch off small “arms” (much like a tree) to reach out to the other cells. A single cell can grow 15,000 connections with its neighbors. This chain reaction of growth ensures it’s easier to kick a new behavior into action in the future. As you train your brain by repeatedly practicing new emotionally intelligent behaviors, your brain builds the pathways needed to make them into habits. Before long, you begin responding to your surroundings with emotional intelligence without even having to think about it. And just as your brain reinforces the use of new behaviors, the connections supporting old, destructive behaviors will die off as you learn to limit your use of them.

the short answer is: a lot! its a powerful way to focus your energy in one direction with a tremendous result. in preparing my new book , i tested emotional intelligence alongside 33 other important workplace skills, and found that emotional intelligence is the strongest predictor of performance, explaining roughly 60 of success in all types of jobs. your emotional intelligence is the foundation for a host of critical skillsit impacts most everything you do and say each day. of all the people ive studied at work, i've found that 90 of top performers are also high in emotional intelligence. on the flip side, just 20 of bottom performers are high in emotional intelligence. you can be a top performer without emotional intelligence, but the chances are slim. naturally, people with a high degree of emotional intelligence make more moneyan average of 37,000 more per year than people with a low degree of emotional intelligence. the link between emotional intelligence and earnings is so direct that every point increase in emotional intelligence adds 1,700 to an annual salary. these findings hold true for people in all industries, at all levels, in every region of the world. i havent yet been able to find a job in which performance and pay arent tied closely to emotional intelligence. you can increase your emotional intelligence the communication between your emotional and rational brains is the physical source of emotional intelligence. the pathway for emotional intelligence starts in the brain, at the spinal cord. your primary senses enter here and must travel to the front of your brain before you can think rationally about your experience. however, first they travel through the limbic system, the place where emotions are generated. so, we have an emotional reaction to events before our rational mind is able to engage. emotional intelligence requires effective communication between the rational and emotional centers of the brain. plasticity is the term neurologists use to describe the brains ability to change. as you discover and practice new emotional intelligence skills, the billions of microscopic neurons lining the road between the rational and emotional centers of your brain branch off small arms much like a tree to reach out to the other cells. a single cell can grow 15,000 connections with its neighbors. this chain reaction of growth ensures its easier to kick a new behavior into action in the future. as you train your brain by repeatedly practicing new emotionally intelligent behaviors, your brain builds the pathways needed to make them into habits. before long, you begin responding to your surroundings with emotional intelligence without even having to think about it. and just as your brain reinforces the use of new behaviors, the connections supporting old, destructive behaviors will die off as you learn to limit your use of them. if you enjoyed this article, click the subscribe button below and you'll receive a new one just like it each week. about the author: if you enjoyed this article, you'll love his new book, the new emotional intelligence . dr. bradberry is the world's #1 bestselling eq author, having sold more than 5 million copies. he has written for, or been covered by, time, usa today, the wall street journal, bloomberg businessweek, fortune, forbes, fast company, and the harvard business review. if you'd like to learn how to increase your eq, consider taking the test that's included via unique passcode in the new emotional intelligence book. your test results will reveal which of the book's 60 strategies will increase your eq the most.",-15,too_long,"when emotional intelligence first appeared to the masses, it served as the missing link in a peculiar finding: people with average iqs outperform those with the highest iqs 70 of the time",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,4,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,60,60

travisbradberry,"Your phone is robbing you of mental clarity. It's also creating a disconnect between you and your emotions. Why? 1) Because constant phone use doesn’t merely distract; it robs the brain of its natural rhythm of boredom, reflection, and spontaneous idea generation. Boredom isn’t wasted time. Boredom is the incubator for creativity, problem-solving, and emotional processing. 2) When you eliminate boredom with endless micro-stimulation, you also eliminate the very conditions under which insight and clarity emerge. Many of life’s most important realizations (shifts in perspective, flashes of creativity, and moments of emotional healing) don’t happen during busyness or distraction. They happen in stillness, when your mind is allowed to wander. The solution? 1) Turn Boredom Into a Signal, Not a Problem Instead of treating boredom as an itch to scratch with stimulation, reframe it as a signal. Your brain is telling you that there is space available. That space is valuable. It’s where reflection, creativity, and subconscious problem-solving thrive. 2) Use the 5-Minute Pause When you feel the urge to grab your phone: Pause for 5 minutes. Tell yourself, “I can look at my phone in five minutes if I still want to.” In that pause, simply notice your surroundings, breathe deeply, or let your mind wander. Often, by the end of five minutes, the compulsion passes because the habit loop is broken and the discomfort of boredom has softened. Why does this work? This works because it creates friction between the urge and the action, which retrains your brain. It reintroduces choice. Instead of reacting automatically, you decide consciously. It turns boredom into a practice ground for presence, rather than something to escape. ---- ♻️ Like, follow, and repost if this resonates. ➕ Follow Travis Bradberry for more and sign up for my weekly newsletter at TravisBradberry.com Do you want more like this? 👇 📖 My #1 bestselling new book, ""The New Emotional Intelligence"" is now available on Amazon for 10% off.",1544.0,89.0,1,,2610325,post,1,0,0,[],0,[],5,5,"['♻', '️', '➕', '👇', '📖']",1,['#1'],2014,1991,323,319,28,4,0,0,"your phone is robbing you of mental clarity. it's also creating a disconnect between you and your emotions. why? 1 because constant phone use doesnt merely distract; it robs the brain of its natural rhythm of boredom, reflection, and spontaneous idea generation. boredom isnt wasted time. boredom is the incubator for creativity, problem-solving, and emotional processing. 2 when you eliminate boredom with endless micro-stimulation, you also eliminate the very conditions under which insight and clarity emerge. many of lifes most important realizations shifts in perspective, flashes of creativity, and moments of emotional healing dont happen during busyness or distraction. they happen in stillness, when your mind is allowed to wander. the solution? 1 turn boredom into a signal, not a problem instead of treating boredom as an itch to scratch with stimulation, reframe it as a signal. your brain is telling you that there is space available. that space is valuable. its where reflection, creativity, and subconscious problem-solving thrive. 2 use the 5-minute pause when you feel the urge to grab your phone: pause for 5 minutes. tell yourself, i can look at my phone in five minutes if i still want to. in that pause, simply notice your surroundings, breathe deeply, or let your mind wander. often, by the end of five minutes, the compulsion passes because the habit loop is broken and the discomfort of boredom has softened. why does this work? this works because it creates friction between the urge and the action, which retrains your brain. it reintroduces choice. instead of reacting automatically, you decide consciously. it turns boredom into a practice ground for presence, rather than something to escape. ---- like, follow, and repost if this resonates. follow travis bradberry for more and sign up for my weekly newsletter at travisbradberry.com do you want more like this? my #1 bestselling new book, ""the new emotional intelligence"" is now available on amazon for 10 off.",-15,too_long,your phone is robbing you of mental clarity,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,-7,3,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,32,32
reidhoffman,"Most founders build first, then figure out distribution. Matt Hall and John Watkinson somewhat did it backwards, though they didn't fully realize it at the time. Years before CryptoPunks, they built an Android customization app for Google that unexpectedly went viral. People made their customized Android characters their profile pictures everywhere. “The profile picture is the most valuable real estate on the internet,” Matt told me. “It's beside every one of your posts—it’s not just one post.” That insight sat with them. When they designed CryptoPunks, the profile picture was the utility. CryptoPunks spread because every owner became a walking billboard. Every Twitter post, every board message, every online interaction advertised their punk to their entire network. Matt and John hoped people would use punks as profile pictures. What they didn't expect was the leap from ""I like this"" to ""I am this."" This shift—from possession to identity—transformed passive collectors into active evangelists. Throughout this journey. Matt and John didn’t nudge people; they nurtured where the community was moving. When the initial launch fizzled with just a handful of claims, they didn't panic or pivot. When Mashable wrote an article and all 10,000 punks got claimed in 24 hours, they didn't try to capitalize with a sequel. When crypto winter hit and one person spent an entire year dumping punks for $40 each, they didn't intervene—they just quietly bought some back and kept the lights on. “We were running the Discord and we were keeping the website up,” John said, even when “there was very little activity.” Matt remembered that it was “a couple hundred people maybe that would just check in,” and that community was “really what kept us going.” Because the community was into it, Matt and John were into it—and kept going onward. No manufactured hype. No forced engagement. No roadmap promising future utility. Just patience and presence. Then January 1, 2021 hit. “2021 just started with a bang,” John said. “I remember New Year’s Day was just the biggest day by far.” Matt added, “it just kept getting crazier and crazier.” The lesson: You can't force viral growth, but you can create the conditions for it and stay alive—and aware—long enough for it to happen. Most founders either give up too early or try too hard to manufacture momentum. Sometimes the best strategy is simply not dying while your community figures out what you've built.

travisbradberry,"Choose energy, not proximity. Growth is social. Your circle is who teaches you how to think. Choose carefully. Your environment trains your nervous system. Some people make life feel lighter. Some make it heavier. Not everyone deserves front-row access to your life. This isn’t about surrounding yourself with “positive” people. It’s about building an environment that makes growth sustainable, especially when things aren’t going well. As you do so, keep these 3 things in mind... 1. Don’t sort people by personality — sort by recovery speed. Inspired, motivated, and open-minded people aren’t positive all the time. What makes them valuable is how quickly they recover from stress, disappointment, or friction. Pay attention to how people respond after a setback. Invest more time in those who recalibrate quickly instead of those who stay stuck in reaction mode. 2. Use proximity strategically, not equally. You don’t need to cut people off to protect your environment. You just need to be intentional about who gets access during high-leverage moments. When you’re making decisions, learning something new, or rebuilding momentum, spend that time with inspired and open-minded people. Save low-energy relationships for low-stakes moments. 3. Let gratitude set the floor for your standards. Grateful people raise the baseline of any group. They don’t eliminate problems, but they prevent relationships from spiraling into entitlement or resentment. In work and friendships, give more weight to people who consistently acknowledge effort and progress.

travisbradberry,"Far too many managers believe that a cutthroat pressure-cooker culture gets results. They think that the harder they crack that whip, the better people will perform. Cutthroat business culture is so prevalent that it’s a cliché in our society, being the inspiration for countless TV shows and movies. The sad thing is that people relate to it on the screen because they’ve seen it firsthand. But just because everybody seems to be doing it doesn’t mean it works; it just makes it easier to stick your head in the sand and ignore the consequences, and, make no mistake about it, the costs associated with treating people poorly are real. High-pressure cutthroat organizations spend 50% more on healthcare for their employees than organizations with a more positive, supportive environment because 80% of workplace accidents are attributed to stress, as are 80% of doctor visits. Cutthroat organizations are actually less productive because they experience significantly lower levels of employee engagement. Organizations with high numbers of disengaged employees have 40% lower earnings per share, are 18% less productive, and have 50% higher turnover. If you’re working in a cutthroat environment, it’s probably negatively affecting your health, and the impact might be big enough that you should seriously consider doing something about it. If you aren’t yet motivated to take action, consider how the following hallmarks of cutthroat environments suck the life out of people. 1. They overwork people. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It’s so tempting to work your best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is often perplexing to them; it makes them feel as if they’re being punished for a great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford shows that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that employers don’t get anything out of the extra work. 2. There’s no empathy. Empathy matters. Does your boss really see you as a person and care how you’re doing, or is he only focused on how much work you churn out? More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationships with their bosses. Smart companies make certain that their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who empathize with those going through hard times, yet still challenge people. Bosses who fail to really care will always have high turnover rates. It’s impossible to work for someone for eight-plus hours a day when they aren’t personally involved and don’t care about anything other than your production yield. 3. They don’t recognize contributions or reward good work. It’s easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially when it comes to top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it’s a raise; for others, it’s public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you’re doing it right. 4. There’s no socializing and no fun. Strong social connections are an integral part of a healthy workplace. People who have strong connections with their colleagues get sick less often, are less likely to become depressed, learn faster, remember more, and simply do a better job. People don’t give their all if they aren’t having fun, and fun is a major protector against burnout. The best companies to work for know the importance of letting employees loosen up a little. Google, for example, does just about everything it can to make work fun—free meals, bowling allies, and fitness classes, to name a few. The idea is simple: if work is fun, you’ll not only perform better, but you’ll stick around for longer hours and an even longer career. 5. They make a lot of stupid rules. Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order. Whether it’s an overzealous attendance policy or taking employees’ frequent flier miles, even a couple of such unnecessary rules can drive people crazy. When good employees feel as though big brother is watching, they’ll find someplace else to work. 6. People don’t help each other out. There’s a big difference between delegating responsibility and abdicating it. A boss who abdicates responsibility thinks that it’s your problem not his and that you alone are responsible for solving it. However, research shows that managers who support their employees in tasks that they delegate produce better team players who are more willing to help others and are more committed to their jobs. 7. They don’t let people pursue their passions. Google mandates that employees spend at least 20% of their time doing “what they believe will benefit Google most.” While these passion projects make major contributions to marquee Google products, such as Gmail and AdSense, their biggest impact is in creating highly engaged Googlers. Talented employees are passionate, and providing opportunities for them to pursue their passions improves their productivity and job satisfaction; however, many managers want people to work within a little box. These managers fear that productivity will decline if they let people expand their focus and pursue their passions. This fear is unfounded. Studies have shown that people who are able to pursue their passions at work experience flow , a euphoric state of mind that is five times more productive than the norm. 8. Bosses don’t listen. When employees feel that their managers are approachable, supportive, and willing to listen, performance improves. That feeling of connection leads to a willingness to experiment and take risks, which, in turn, leads to better outcomes. On the other hand, if conversations between managers and employees never extend beyond TPS reports, and any attempts to ask questions or offer suggestions are rebuffed, the work environment is probably cutthroat. Moving Forward So what should you do if you are working in a cutthroat environment? Should you leave? I can’t answer that question for you. What I can do is tell you that the mental and physical consequences are real. Even if you decide to stick it out because you think the potential payout is worth the short-term sacrifice, just be certain you’re not sacrificing something you can’t get back—your health.

baptiste-parravicini,"Big Story: AI Is Forcing APIs to Become Explicit About Intent Key Takeaways Many APIs were designed with the expectation that humans would infer intent from documentation and examples. Automated and agentic workflows depend on intent being explicitly represented and machine-readable. This shift is pushing teams toward richer schemas, clearer contracts, and intent-aware metadata across APIs. For a long time, APIs operated on a quiet assumption that humans sat somewhere in the loop. Developers read documentation, interpreted endpoint names, inferred meaning from examples, and compensated for unclear behavior. Ambiguity was manageable because people could compensate for it. Intent existed across documentation, shared knowledge, and engineering judgment. That model breaks once APIs are consumed primarily by machines. AI-driven clients depend on explicit signals. These include structured schemas, consistent semantics, and predictable behavior. When intent is underspecified, automation produces incorrect behavior that can be difficult to diagnose and expensive to correct. This highlights a gap that has existed in API design for years. Many endpoints describe what they do, but provide limited guidance on when they should be used or under what conditions. Humans can navigate these gaps by interpreting context. Automated systems cannot. In agentic workflows, these gaps accumulate. API calls feed into other calls. Decisions are chained. Small misunderstandings propagate. Teams are starting to treat intent as part of the API surface. Schemas are being expanded to communicate meaning. Contracts increasingly describe expectations, constraints, and acceptable usage patterns. This changes how APIs are governed and operated in practice. Policies can be applied based on declared purpose. Rate limits can reflect observed usage patterns. Observability improves because behavior can be evaluated against stated intent. As AI agents plan and act autonomously, APIs become tools whose behavior must be discoverable and dependable. An underspecified API introduces uncertainty that compounds across decisions. Making intent explicit is what allows autonomy to scale without losing control. In an AI-driven environment, APIs function as instructions for machine-operated systems. Intent becomes part of the contract and is designed, versioned, and governed alongside other system boundaries. API Feed Kubernetes published guidance on API server bypass risks, highlighting that workloads outside normal API control paths can still take security-sensitive actions. Security posture cannot be inferred from API level restrictions alone, and node-level and host-level access paths need explicit controls and monitoring. ( Reference ) Microsoft outlined a runtime-focused approach to securing AI agents, centered on controlling tool use during execution rather than assuming static guardrails are sufficient. For API and platform teams, this reinforces that agent safety is becoming an operations problem, where policy enforcement, identity, and telemetry have to work in the execution path. ( Reference ) Arize described observability-driven sandboxing for agent tool execution, where tool invocations emit traces that capture policy checks and decisions. Sandboxing is trending toward being measurable and auditable, which helps teams debug behavior and enforce controls without guessing what happened. ( Reference ) Harness shipped January updates that frame SRE and API security work around AI-assisted operations, including automation tied to incidents and API hygiene. Reliability and API security tooling is being packaged around agent workflows, which will pressure orgs to standardize naming, ownership, and response playbooks. ( Reference ) Community Spotlight Austin Parker: Operating Observability as Production Infrastructure As software systems become more automated and traffic patterns less predictable, observability is shifting from a developer convenience to a core operational requirement. That is why Austin Parker has become a reference point for teams trying to make observability work at scale. A long-time OpenTelemetry maintainer and Director of Open Source at Honeycomb, Parker focuses on how telemetry behaves in real production environments. Rather than treating observability as instrumentation sprinkled across services, Parker frames it as infrastructure that needs ownership, consistency, and control. Much of his work emphasizes the OpenTelemetry Collector as a coordination layer, where configuration, routing, and policy decisions live centrally instead of being duplicated across teams. This approach reflects the reality of large systems, where drift and inconsistency create more blind spots than missing metrics. In recent writing and community work, Parker has highlighted how automation and agent-driven workloads change observability requirements. Non-linear traffic, retries, and chained tool calls increase volume and variance, making ad hoc telemetry pipelines fragile. His focus has been on declarative configuration and standardized pipelines as a way to keep telemetry reliable as systems scale and automate. Parkerʼs perspective stands out because it avoids promises of visibility through tooling alone. He consistently points out that observability fails when it is treated as an afterthought or left to individual teams to manage independently. As systems become more autonomous, Telemetry has to be governable and predictable, or it stops being useful when teams need it most.

reidhoffman,"This week, Parth and I discussed enterprise AI, and why most large companies might be focusing in the wrong place when it comes to the “adoption” of AI. AI in enterprise gets framed like a shopping trip: pick a model, buy seats, spin up a pilot, require employees to report back usage and performance stats, and call it a strategy. Parth’s argument (and I think he’s right) is that this is backwards. The fastest path to real enterprise ROI using AI isn’t a moonshot transformation, but real application of agentic tools into the unglamorous layer of where organizations bleed time: communication, coordination, and the “who owns this, what did we decide, who needs to know” layer of work that can compound into organizational drag. And to those who think they’re behind, most enterprise clients haven’t figured out mass AI adoption. Many are still in the “committee to study leaving the dugout” phase. In other words, they’re still setting up pilots or tests, but not building the muscle of day-to-day use. That matters because the winners will be the companies that start learning early enough that the gains compound. Learning 1: Start with the coordination layer. It’s the highest-leverage, lowest-drama place to deploy AI. Language models are great at language, and they love context. The biggest language workload inside any enterprise is the coordination layer: Meetings, notes, docs, action items, status updates, decision memos, stakeholder coordination. Humans are not computers. We forget. We context-switch. AI can be the system that remembers. This is where executives should look to find early wins that don’t require rebuilding core systems (or creating entirely new ones). If an organization focuses on building a strong database of meetings, transcripts, documents, and agendas and run them through an AI workflow that reliably produces summaries, action items, owners, follow-ups, and stakeholders to inform. The goal is turning the organization’s memory into something structured and retrievable, so you stop relying on whoever happened to be in the room to (1) achieve the objective discussed and (2) decide on who else should be informed. Also, for those who want more trust in the system, you can add a light “human in the loop” interface — the agent that suggests who to notify, and you approve — so you get the benefits without the fear of an agent going rogue. Learning 2: Enterprise AI gains compound if you make them shareable. A pattern Parth called out (and I’ve seen it too), is one where big companies create a small AI tiger team to run a proof-of-concept, then expect transformation to magically spread. Unfortunately for that strategy, AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is. They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned. Building a strong AI culture within an organization can be a massive differentiator. If people feel they’ll get punished or judged for using AI, they become what Ethan Mollick calls “secret cyborgs,” who quietly speed up their own work while the organization learns nothing. The enterprise advantage of learning at scale only shows up when experimentation is rewarded and the wins are socialized. This can be modeled by folks at the top, or encouraged to be completely done bottom-up. In short, maybe your goal isn’t just adoption, but collective AI understanding. Learning 3: Coding agents collapse the cost of analysis, which changes the kind of questions enterprises can afford to ask. Parth did a demo that showed how weeks of work can be compressed into minutes. He pointed a coding agent at a folder of raw CSVs — order items, refunds, basic business data — and asked it to analyze everything and generate a dashboard. Then he asked it to create a McKinsey-style presentation from the analysis. The surface-level takeaway is “wow, it made a dashboard and slides fast” but the deeper takeaway is that it collapses the feedback loop that normally makes insight expensive. In the old world, an executive emails the analytics team, waits a day or two, gets a cut, and iterates slowly. In the new world, the executive can run the loop in real time. When the cost of asking is near zero, you stop asking only the “necessary” questions and begin naturally going deeper. For example: Asking for a dashboard and then seeing what your team decided to put up top, versus creating a dashboard and querying it live about patterns that you might’ve missed, or changes in customer LTV by season versus just by demographic. Parth also made a point I love: language models are unusually good at turning messy reality into structured inputs — extracting action items from complaints, turning transcripts into CRM-ready fields, converting unstructured text into something your systems can use. That’s one of the easiest automation targets inside the enterprise stack, and it’s a bridge between the human world and the database world. This was part two of my three-part series with Parth, who was the first data scientist at Clubhouse, the co-creator of my digital twin, Reid AI, and an advisor to companies on AI products and strategy.

comes to the adoption of ai. ai in enterprise gets framed like a shopping trip: pick a model, buy seats, spin up a pilot, require employees to report back usage and performance stats, and call it a strategy. parths argument and i think hes right is that this is backwards. the fastest path to real enterprise roi using ai isnt a moonshot transformation, but real application of agentic tools into the unglamorous layer of where organizations bleed time: communication, coordination, and the who owns this, what did we decide, who needs to know layer of work that can compound into organizational drag. and to those who think theyre behind, most enterprise clients havent figured out mass ai adoption. many are still in the committee to study leaving the dugout phase. in other words, theyre still setting up pilots or tests, but not building the muscle of day-to-day use. that matters because the winners will be the companies that start learning early enough that the gains compound. learning 1: start with the coordination layer. its the highest-leverage, lowest-drama place to deploy ai. language models are great at language, and they love context. the biggest language workload inside any enterprise is the coordination layer: meetings, notes, docs, action items, status updates, decision memos, stakeholder coordination. humans are not computers. we forget. we context-switch. ai can be the system that remembers. this is where executives should look to find early wins that dont require rebuilding core systems or creating entirely new ones. if an organization focuses on building a strong database of meetings, transcripts, documents, and agendas and run them through an ai workflow that reliably produces summaries, action items, owners, follow-ups, and stakeholders to inform. the goal is turning the organizations memory into something structured and retrievable, so you stop relying on whoever happened to be in the room to 1 achieve the objective discussed and 2 decide on who else should be informed. also, for those who want more trust in the system, you can add a light human in the loop interface  the agent that suggests who to notify, and you approve  so you get the benefits without the fear of an agent going rogue. learning 2: enterprise ai gains compound if you make them shareable. a pattern parth called out and ive seen it too, is one where big companies

Great engineers write code that scales. When interviewers ask about time complexity, they’re not testing memorization. They’re testing: Do you understand trade-offs? Can you optimize under constraints? Do you think beyond “it runs”?

baptiste-parravicini,"Big Story: API Economics Are Moving to the Forefront Key Takeaways As APIs become execution layers for AI and automation, cost and usage economics are becoming first-order design concerns. Agentic workloads introduce bursty, non-linear traffic patterns that break traditional API pricing and capacity models. FinOps, rate design, and usage controls are converging with API governance. Teams that model API cost early gain flexibility without sacrificing reliability or control. For most of the API era, economics were a secondary concern. APIs were internal, traffic was predictable, and costs scaled roughly in line with the growth of the product. That assumption no longer holds. As APIs increasingly sit behind AI agents, automated workflows, and tool-driven orchestration, usage patterns are becoming harder to forecast and more expensive to absorb. The change is structural. Agentic systems donʼt behave like humans or even traditional applications. They retry aggressively, chain calls across services, and operate continuously rather than intermittently. A single workflow can fan out into dozens of API calls, often across multiple systems, and small design choices can multiply costs dramatically at scale. In this environment, API economics stop being a billing issue and start becoming a platform design problem. Leading teams are responding by pulling economic thinking earlier into the API lifecycle. Rate limits, quotas, and usage tiers are no longer blunt safeguards. They are being tuned dynamically based on workload type, consumer identity, and business priority. Some organizations are introducing cost-aware routing and policy enforcement, where APIs expose not just functionality but expected cost envelopes to downstream systems. This shift is also reshaping how API ownership works internally. Platform teams are collaborating more closely with finance and product leaders to understand which APIs are strategic assets and which are cost centers. Observability data is being reused for economic insight, helping teams attribute spend to specific consumers, workflows, and use cases. The result is a clearer picture of which APIs deserve further investment and which need tighter controls. The broader implication is that API maturity now includes economic literacy. Teams that design APIs with cost transparency, usage discipline, and economic intent in mind are better positioned to support AI-driven growth without constant firefighting. In the next phase of the API economy, the question is no longer just “Can this API scale?” but “Can it scale sustainably?” API Feed API sprawl is emerging as a frontline risk in the agentic era. As teams add more internal endpoints and tool integrations, the real problem becomes discoverability and control. When agents can access unknown APIs, governance gaps become security gaps, and missed APIs become missed leverage opportunities. ( Reference ) Cloud leaders are increasingly planning for AI agent meshes as a core architectural layer. These meshes act as coordination hubs for agent-to-agent and agent-to-model interactions, pushing API platforms to define clearer contracts, smarter routing, and stronger policy controls as traffic becomes predominantly machine-driven. ( Reference ) API leaders are being pushed to map their API landscape. Agentic workflows will punish fragmented, undocumented interfaces, and the fastest path to safer autonomy is organizing APIs around business capabilities and clear contracts before agents start chaining them at scale.

travisbradberry,"Companies need to have rules—that’s a given—but they don’t have to be shortsighted and lazy attempts at creating order. I understand the temptation. As my company grew, so did our difficulty maintaining standards. There were many instances where someone crossed a line, and we were tempted to respond with a new rule that applied to everyone. But that’s where most companies blow it. In just about every instance, upon closer inspection, we realized that establishing a new rule would be a passive and morale-killing way to address the problem. The vast majority of the time, the problem needs to be handled one-on-one by the employee’s manager. When companies create ridiculous and demoralizing rules to halt the outlandish behavior of a few individuals, it’s a management problem. There’s no sense in alienating your entire workforce because you don’t know how to manage performance. It makes a bad situation that much worse. Here are some of the worst rules that companies create when they fall into this trap. 1. Bell curves and forced rankings of performance. Some individual talents follow a natural bell-shaped curve, but job performance does not. When you force employees to fit into a pre-determined ranking system, you do three things: 1) incorrectly evaluate people’s performance, 2) make everyone feel like a number, and 3) create insecurity and dissatisfaction when performing employees fear that they’ll be fired due to the forced system. This is yet another example of a lazy policy that avoids the hard and necessary work of evaluating each individual objectively, based on his or her merits. 2. Ridiculous requirements for attendance, leave, and time off. People are salaried for the work they do, not the specific hours they sit at their desks. When you ding salaried employees for showing up five minutes late even though they routinely stay late and put in time on the weekend, you send the message that policies take precedence over performance. It reeks of distrust, and you should never put someone on salary that you don’t trust. When companies are unnecessarily strict in requiring documentation for bereavement and medical leave, it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of employees who deserve better. After all, if you have employees who will fake a death to miss a day’s work, what does that say about your company? 3. Restricting internet use. There are certain sites that no one should be visiting at work, and I’m not talking about Facebook. But once you block pornography and the other obvious stuff, it’s a difficult and arbitrary process deciding where to draw the line. Most companies draw it in the wrong place. People should be able to kill time on the Internet during breaks. When companies unnecessarily restrict people’s Internet activity, it does more than demoralize those that can’t check Facebook; it limits people’s ability to do their jobs. Many companies restrict Internet activity so heavily that it makes it difficult for people to do online research. The most obvious example? Checking the Facebook profile of someone you just interviewed. 4. Banning mobile phones. If I ban mobile phones in the office, no one will waste time texting and talking to family and friends, right? Ya, right. Organizations need to do the difficult work of hiring people who are trustworthy and who won’t take advantage of things. They also need to train managers to deal effectively with employees who underperform and/or violate expectations (such as spending too much time on their phones). This is also hard work, but it’s worth it. The easy, knee-jerk alternative (banning phones) demoralizes good employees who need to check their phones periodically due to pressing family or health issues or as an appropriate break from work. 5. Draconian e-mail policies. This is a newer one that’s already moving down a slippery slope. Some companies are getting so restrictive with e-mail use that employees must select from a list of pre-approved topics before the e-mail software will allow them to send a message. Again, it’s about trust. If you don’t trust your people to use e-mail properly, why did you hire them in the first place? In trying to rein in the bad guys, you make everyone miserable every time they send an e-mail. And guess what? The bad guys are the ones who will find ways to get around any system you put in place. 6. Stealing employees’ frequent-flyer miles. If there’s one thing that road-weary traveling employees earn, it’s their frequent flier miles. When employers don’t let people keep their miles for personal use, it’s a greedy move that fuels resentment with every flight. Work travel is a major sacrifice of time, energy, and sanity. Taking employees’ miles sends the message that you don’t appreciate their sacrifice and that you’ll hold on to every last dollar at their expense. 7. Pathetic attempts at political correctness. Maintaining high standards for how people treat each other is a wonderful thing as we live in a world that’s rife with animosity and discrimination. Still employers have to know where to draw the line. Going on a witch-hunt because someone says “Bless you” to another employee that sneezed (real example) creates an environment of paranoia and stifled self-expression, without improving how people treat each other. 8. Shutting down self-expression (personal items and dress code). Many organizations control what people can have at their desks. A life-size poster of a shirtless Jason Momoa? I get it; that’s a problem. But employers dictate how many photographs people can display, whether or not they can use a water bottle, and how many items they’re allowed to place on their desks. Once again, it’s the ol’ “If I could just hire robots I wouldn’t have this problem” approach. Same goes for dress codes. They work well in private high schools, but they’re unnecessary at work. Hire professionals and they’ll dress professionally. When someone crosses the line, their manager needs to have the skill to address the issue directly. Otherwise, you’re making everyone wish they worked somewhere else because management is too inept to handle touchy subjects effectively. Moving Forward If companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, we’ll all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work.

3. restricting internet use. there are certain sites that no one should be visiting at work, and im not talking about facebook. but once you block pornography and the other obvious stuff, its a difficult and arbitrary process deciding where to draw the line. most companies draw it in the wrong place. people should be able to kill time on the internet during breaks. when companies unnecessarily restrict peoples internet activity, it does more than demoralize those that cant check facebook; it limits peoples ability to do their jobs. many companies restrict internet activity so heavily that it makes it difficult for people to do online research. the most obvious example? checking the facebook profile of someone you just interviewed. 4. banning mobile phones. if i ban mobile phones in the office, no one will waste time texting and talking to family and friends, right? ya, right. organizations need to do the difficult work of hiring people who are trustworthy and who wont take advantage of things. they also need to train managers to deal effectively with employees who underperform andor violate expectations such as spending too much time on their phones. this is also hard work, but its worth it. the easy, knee-jerk alternative banning phones demoralizes good employees who need to check their phones periodically due to pressing family or health issues or as an appropriate break from work. 5. draconian e-mail policies. this is a newer one thats already moving down a slippery slope. some companies are getting so restrictive with e-mail use that employees must select from a list of pre-approved topics before the e-mail software will allow them to send a message. again, its about trust. if you dont trust your people to use e-mail properly, why did you hire them in the first place? in trying to rein in the bad guys, you make everyone miserable every time they send an e-mail. and guess what? the bad guys are the ones who will find ways to get around any system you put in place. 6. stealing employees frequent-flyer miles. if theres one thing that road-weary traveling employees earn, its their frequent flier miles. when employers dont let people keep their miles for personal use, its a greedy move that fuels resentment with every flight. work travel is a major sacrifice of time, energy, and sanity. taking employees miles sends the message that you dont appreciate their sacrifice and that youll hold on to every last dollar at their expense. 7. pathetic attempts at political correctness. maintaining high standards for how people treat each other is a wonderful thing as we live in a world thats rife with animosity and discrimination. still employers have to know where to draw the line. going on a witch-hunt because someone says bless you to another employee that sneezed real example creates an environment of paranoia and stifled self-expression, without improving how people treat each other. 8. shutting down self-expression personal items and dress code. many organizations control what people can have at their desks. a life-size poster of a shirtless jason momoa? i get it; thats a problem. but employers dictate how many photographs people can display, whether or not they can use a water bottle, and how many items theyre allowed to place on their desks. once again, its the ol if i could just hire robots i wouldnt have this problem approach. same goes for dress codes. they work well in private high schools, but theyre unnecessary at work. hire professionals and theyll dress professionally. when someone crosses the line, their manager needs to have the skill to address the issue directly. otherwise, youre making everyone wish they worked somewhere else because management is too inept to handle touchy subjects effectively. moving forward if companies can rethink their policies and remove or alter those that are unnecessary or demoralizing, well all have a more enjoyable and productive time at work. what other policies drive you bananas?

travisbradberry,"Why would you want to speak like a leader? True leaders have confidence and experience as distinguishing characteristics that are reflected in their speech. This has a positive influence on others. Thing is, you have confidence and experience too. You just need to let it show when you open your mouth. How you phrase statements and questions determines their impact. This list provides subtle shifts that help you to sound and ultimately feel more confident. Consider the following: 🔹 1. Language shapes perception. These reframes aren't just about changing words—they're about shifting how others experience your competence and confidence. For example, “I recommend...” signals clarity and leadership, while “I think maybe...” invites uncertainty. 🔹 2. Confidence doesn’t mean arrogance—it means ownership. Phrases like “Drawing from my experience…” or “I’m currently improving…” show humility without self-deprecation. They frame growth as a strength, not a flaw. 🔹 3. Remove apologies, add intention. “Sorry to bother you” and “Sorry for the delay” place you in a submissive posture. Replacing them with time-conscious, respectful alternatives communicates professionalism—not guilt. 🔹 4. Reframing builds trust. People follow those who sound sure of their ideas, respect their own time, and offer solutions.

paramanantham,"A customer asked a tough one recently: “We’ve got over a thousand scanned technical PDFs — 100+ pages each — and we want engineers to instantly find fixes for error codes. But… everything must stay on-prem.” No cloud, no vector DB API, no OpenAI embedding calls. Here’s how we tackled it 👇 1. OCR Pipeline – We used an OCR stage to extract text from scanned PDFs. Split content into sentence-aware chunks (~500–1000 chars) Added metadata like brand , model , error code , page number for better precision 2. Local Embeddings – Ran embeddings fully offline with Ollama and Mistral . Stored vectors using pgvector on PostgreSQL No data leaves the local network 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Engineers query: “Error 17 on model X900 during calibration” Query rewriter reformulates → retrieves semantically relevant chunks → LLM summarizes exact fix 4. Validation & Monitoring – Each answer links back to its original source paragraph Engineers can mark answers as verified — creating a live feedback loop 💡 The result: Engineers find solutions 10× faster All data remains on-prem and compliant The system scales to thousands of documents seamlessly This project reinforced a big lesson: 👉 Real-world AI isn’t just about LLMs — it’s about architecting private, reliable, and explainable intelligence on your data.

reidhoffman,"When people think about who’s going to shape the future of AI, they usually picture a familiar set of actors: frontier labs, tech companies, regulators, perhaps the President. They don’t typically put “the Pope” anywhere near the top of that list. I think that’s a mistake. This week on Possible, I talk a bit about why more technologists should listen to the Pope. Pope Leo, the first American pope, recently posted on X that he wants the AI industry to cultivate “moral discernment” and build systems that reflect justice, solidarity, and reverence for life. To me, these are almost the definition of table stakes. And yet, a noticeable slice of the AI builder community reacted negatively towards his comments. That friction, to me, says something important about why the Catholic Church—and Pope Leo in particular—may have a more significant role to play in the AI era than many technologists realize. The Catholic Church has a kind of institutional power and coherence that is nearly unique in today’s fragmented world. In the United States, the Church runs a significant share of secondary schools and nearly a fifth of all hospitals. Globally, it’s a centralized hierarchy, a network of universities and research centers, and importantly holds a centuries-long tradition of thinking seriously about ethics, work, and community. When someone like Pope Leo speaks about AI, he’s speaking on behalf of that massive network, which gives him a very particular kind of leverage over the cultural dialogue around AI, and how it is implemented at various levels of society. What the Pope thinks, and believes, will also be reflected in how many of these institutions act over the next few decades. I’ve seen some of this up close. Over the past decade, starting with Pope Francis and continuing with Pope Leo, the Vatican has become an unexpected but important node in the global AI conversation. Many of the leaders of the frontier labs have made trips to Rome and sat in rooms with cardinals, bishops, and Vatican scholars to talk about AI’s trajectory. I’ve helped connect some of those dots, because I believe we need more spaces where technical expertise and moral tradition can actually talk to each other, not just snipe across social media. The Church has been studying the relationship between work, dignity, and community for a very long time. Catholic social teaching has a rich tradition of asking how economic systems can support or undermine the flourishing of ordinary people. When that tradition turns its attention to AI, it asks: “What does this technology do to our understanding of human beings and our obligations to one another?” When the Pope calls for moral discernment, a certain faction in the Valley hears “moral discernment” and translates it as “you’re trying to slow me down” or “this is just another flavor of ‘woke’ politics coming for technology.” Neither of these reactions could be further from the truth. In fact, technologists must be considering questions about how the things we build impact the humans who use them. We tend to obsess over competence: can this system perform the task, hit the metric, beat the benchmark? The Church’s questions force us to ask a different set of questions: how does this fit into a meaningful life? How does it fit into a healthy society? Where does work fit into the fabric of human purpose and connection? Those might sound like abstract questions, but they’re actually very practical. Plainly: if we build AI that is fantastically competent but corrosive to meaning and community, we’ll have succeeded in engineering and failed in humanity. I’m very much in favor of builders building. But there’s a difference between valuing speed and treating any philosophical questions about technology as illegitimate. If we start to believe that the ones writing the code are the sole experts on what humanity should become, we’ve drifted into a kind of hubris that is both intellectually weak and morally dangerous. I don’t agree with everything the Catholic Church says or does. No institution gets everything right, and the Catholic Church has made many bad and harmful decisions that have been well documented by history. But I do think the Church, under leaders like Pope Leo, can be a powerful partner in steering AI toward better human outcomes. It has the infrastructure to convene serious actors. It has a long-running intellectual tradition focused on dignity, work, and community. And it has a global moral voice that reaches many people who will never read a technical paper or tune into a developer livestream.

gharabat,"I read somewhere that Y Combinator is now asking applicants to attach a coding session (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) with their applications. I was super happy to hear that. We have been doing this for months already. When we interview a product engineering candidate, we invite them for an on-site work session where we give them a laptop and a real-life task. The laptop has Cursor and everything they need to use AI for coding. After they are done, we review their chat logs with Cursor or the AI to see how they think. This is our number one way of deciding whether we will hire someone or not. A bad builder or candidate keeps asking the AI to do things with no direction, no design principles, and most importantly, no empathy. They just build. They let the AI lead the direction, which usually results in a really bad product experience: too many UI elements (AI agents tend to do way too many things) and an overall poor experience. Great builders, on the other hand, instruct the AI in a deep, meaningful way. They stress over the smallest details, so you can clearly see that the AI is a tool and they are the driver.

sonumahanty,"The biggest confusion students face today isn’t whether to learn coding. It’s what to learn, in what order, and how much is enough. Every day I see students jumping between YouTube playlists, random sheets, and half-finished courses, working hard but still feeling lost. Because in tech, direction matters more than effort. Over the past few months, many students have asked me about a structured path for DSA and interview preparation. One platform that consistently comes up in these conversations is takeUforward (TUF+). What makes TUF+ genuinely useful It isn’t just a course; it’s a guided roadmap built around how students actually grow from beginner → internship → product company roles. Here’s what stands out: • A step-by-step DSA roadmap from basics to advanced • The famous Striver Sheets ecosystem (A2Z DSA Sheet, SDE Sheet, etc.) in a structured learning flow •With SQL now included, TUF+ covers DSA, OOP, LLD, SQL & Data Engineering, DBMS, CN, OS, aptitude, and company-specific questions. all in one place. • Regular live sessions, problem-solving classes & mentorship • Focus on internships, placements, and product company preparation • A strong peer community that keeps students consistent and accountable Why this matters, especially for early-year students For 1st & 2nd year students, the biggest advantage is starting early with the right order: • Build problem-solving before placement pressure starts • Avoid the final-year panic most students face • Develop long-term consistency instead of last-minute preparation And yes, it works alongside GATE prep Many GATE aspirants struggle with balancing core subjects and coding. A structured DSA roadmap helps you: • Build programming strength for interviews • Improve problem-solving and logical thinking • Prepare for internships and backup career options while targeting GATE For anyone feeling stuck or overwhelmed about what to study next, structure is often the biggest unlock. Sharing the link ( Maximum Discount Applied Automatically) here for those who were asking: 👉 https://lnkd.in/gupwYMfu If you’ve explored TUF+, I’d love to hear your experience. “The right direction at the right time can change an entire career.” If you found this helpful, share it with students and your community who might need this guidance.

fiachramacfadden,"It’s now been a month since I launched my first app – Zhiyin: Learn Chinese with Music – on the App Store! Zhiyin (知音) has since garnered over 1,400 downloads, with users in every single continent. North America makes up my highest user base, followed closely by Southeast Asia, China (quite a lot in China to my surprise!) and Europe. This is thanks largely to my organic marketing on TikTok, but also some subtle marketing in the comments of viral videos on Instagram (will discuss this in future videos), as well as people randomly finding my app through App Store searches. $0.00 ad spend. To my surprise and delight, I’ve also found that both Claude & ChatGPT (at least, the latest models) are suggesting Zhiyin to users who are looking for music based Chinese language learning apps. These numbers are great but nothing compares to hearing directly from the people behind them! I have some amazing users who have been sending me feedback and sharing their goals with me in using the app. Almost everyday now, I am talking to users via email or TikTok/Instagram DMs. Some emails to me are extremely long, some short, and on a couple occasions I have even received google docs with annotated screenshots giving feedback! Sometimes I almost catch myself thinking “gosh, this app sucks - look at all these complaints!” But I quickly remind myself that these people took the time to write out all this feedback to me because they care and want to see Zhiyin get better. And how lucky I am to have such supportive users! Together, this has allowed me to ship new updates of the app every single week. These updates include bug fixes, refining existing flows, but also big new features like Shazam integration, so users can instantly identify a chinese song playing in a taxi or restaurant, with Zhiyin showing them the pinyin, English translation and a grammar guide of the song within seconds. Other features and big new updates coming soon. I also recently came to the end of my contract at my job. The contract was not one that could be extended, and I knew this day was coming for a while. I prepared for this and have a bit of runway now to either spend time looking for new roles OR go full time on Zhiyin. Given that Zhiyin has shown great traction with me just working on it on evenings and weekends, I think I ought to go full time on it for the next few months and see what comes from this work. I have several new paying users every week and I’m hopeful that if I work on Zhiyin full time, I can increase this by quite a bit.

baptiste-parravicini,"Big Story: API Maturity Shifts Focus From Expansion to Management Key Takeaways API work at scale is increasingly focused on stabilizing and clarifying existing behavior. As usage grows, undocumented behavior and edge cases become primary sources of operational risk and support burden. Release cycles are shifting toward limits, observability, configuration, and policy controls that make real-world API usage more predictable. In many organizations, API development has shifted away from rapid surface expansion toward ongoing operational refinement. New endpoints continue to be introduced, but they represent a smaller share of overall effort. Most API work now centers on clarifying contracts, tightening edge cases, and reducing the operational cost of how APIs are already used in production. This trend is visible in recent platform and gateway release notes. Updates increasingly emphasize limits, quotas, metadata, observability, configuration, and policy controls. Teams are adjusting defaults, formalizing behaviors that were previously implicit, and adding instrumentation to better understand established traffic patterns. Once an API reaches broad adoption, change becomes expensive. Consumers may rely on undocumented behavior. Automated clients encode timing assumptions. Minor inconsistencies can trigger retries, retries amplify load, and load exposes weaknesses that were irrelevant at lower volumes. As usage stabilizes, API teams focus on making behavior explicit and predictable. Error responses are standardized. Pagination and filtering rules are formalized. Rate limits are tuned based on observed usage rather than theoretical capacity. Timeouts and retries are documented and enforced more consistently. While these efforts are not highly visible, they reduce incident frequency, support overhead, and operational variance. This shift also changes how API success is evaluated. Instead of measuring progress by the number of new endpoints or integrations, teams track stability indicators like fewer incidents tied to ambiguous behavior, lower variability in request patterns, and more predictable cost profiles. For mature API programs, this pattern is becoming normal. The primary challenge is deciding which existing behaviors should be preserved, constrained, or removed. Over time, the value of the API is defined by how consistently it behaves. API Feed OpenAI disclosed that its API business added over $1 billion in annual recurring revenue in a single month, according to comments from Sam Altman, signaling that OpenAIʼs core growth engine is shifting from consumer subscriptions toward infrastructure and developer-led usage. ( Reference ) Postmanʼs v11 release continues shifting the platform from a request-centric API client toward an agent-ready API workbench, with Agent Mode and MCP server capabilities integrated alongside core lifecycle tools such as Specs, Flows, Governance, and Workspaces. ( Reference ) Google Cloud API Gateway added support for publishing API metadata to Apigee API hub, enabling a centralized inventory of APIs across gateways for discovery and governance. This addresses API sprawl directly by making the complete surface area visible and standardized, which is a prerequisite for controlling machine-driven usage and assigning clear ownership at scale. ( Reference ) Celigoʼs January 2026 release focuses on operational upgrades for integration-heavy environments, including improved navigation, API usage, and entitlement visibility at the subscription level, higher per-connection concurrency limits, deeper connection diagnostics, and real-time SQL Server CDC exports to reduce polling overhead. These changes reflect a broader shift in integration platforms toward acting as governance and observability layers for API consumption, as the operational cost of opaque, high-volume automation continues to rise. ( Reference ) Community Spotlight Erik Wilde: Making API Contracts Machine-Readable at Scale As APIs shift from being human-operated integration points to machine-consumed execution surfaces, the teams that succeed are the ones that invest in clarity and coordination. Thatʼs why Erik Wilde has become an increasingly important voice for API and platform leaders navigating this transition. An OpenAPI Initiative ambassador and long-time API researcher, Wilde focuses on how standards, contracts, and governance actually work in large, multi-team environments. Rather than treating OpenAPI as documentation, Wilde frames it as a coordination mechanism. His work emphasizes that most large API programs fail because interfaces drift, ownership becomes unclear, and contracts stop reflecting reality. In an agentic world, those gaps are actively dangerous because automated clients guess, retry, and amplify ambiguity instead of asking clarifying questions. In recent writing and talks, Wilde has pushed on a question many enterprises are only starting to confront: whether their API descriptions are truly usable by machines. That means schemas that are complete, error semantics that are explicit, and versioning policies that reflect how systems actually evolve. As agents begin chaining APIs autonomously, these details determine whether workflows remain predictable or quietly degrade under load. Wildeʼs perspective is especially valuable because it avoids hype. He doesnʼt argue that standards will magically solve agentic complexity. Instead, he shows how disciplined API description and governance reduce risk, improve reuse, and make automated consumption safer by default. For platform teams, the takeaway is that API contracts are becoming part of the enterprise operating system, and treating them casually is no longer an option.

Big Story: Reliability Engineering for Multi-Cloud API Dependencies Key Takeaways Modern applications depend on large networks of third-party APIs across multiple clouds and SaaS vendors. Reliability engineering is expanding beyond internal services to include external API dependencies. Failover strategies, traffic routing, and vendor diversification are becoming part of API platform design. Observability and ownership must now extend across organizational and cloud boundaries. Over the last decade, most reliability engineering practices focused on services teams directly controlled. Organizations built redundancy across regions, introduced circuit breakers, and designed for graceful degradation within their own infrastructure. Todayʼs production systems rely heavily on third-party APIs for payments, identity, communications, logistics, data enrichment, and AI services. These dependencies often span multiple vendors and cloud providers. As a result, reliability is no longer determined only by internal uptime. It is increasingly shaped by the availability and behavior of external APIs. When an external dependency fails, they surface as a partial failure across workflows in forms of checkout flows that stall during payment authorization, onboarding flows that break during identity verification, or automated pipelines that fail when a data provider becomes unavailable. To manage this risk, platform teams are beginning to treat third-party APIs as reliability domains that require the same engineering rigor as internal services. This includes formal dependency mapping, service-level objectives that incorporate external providers, and runbooks designed specifically for vendor outages. Instead of assuming availability, teams are planning for degradation and recovery. Traffic routing strategies are evolving as well. Multi-vendor failover patterns are becoming more common, particularly in categories such as payments, messaging, and AI inference. Systems are designed to switch providers when latency spikes or error rates exceed thresholds. This approach introduces new design challenges, including schema compatibility, consistent error handling, and data synchronization across providers. Observability is expanding to support this broader scope. Monitoring no longer focuses solely on internal metrics. It now includes external latency, rate-limit behavior, quota consumption, and vendor-specific error patterns. Correlation across these signals helps teams understand whether failures originate inside their systems or within upstream dependencies. Ownership boundaries are changing alongside these technical shifts. When critical workflows depend on external APIs, responsibility cannot stop at the integration layer. Teams must define escalation paths, maintain vendor communication channels, and incorporate third-party incidents into reliability planning. As API ecosystems continue to grow, resilience increasingly depends on how well organizations design for the reliability of services they do not control and ensure continuity when external dependencies inevitably fail. API Feed GitGuardian identifies the rapid growth of non-human identities NHIs as a primary security challenge for 2026. As automation and AI agents proliferate, organizations are increasingly adopting graph-based approaches to map relationships between agents, secrets, and APIs, highlighting the growing complexity of identity and secret management in API ecosystems. ( Reference ) Radware announced the acquisition of Pynt, expanding its capabilities into full-lifecycle API security testing, from pre-production discovery and contract testing to runtime protection. This consolidation signals that API security tooling is becoming a core part of the application delivery portfolio. ( Reference ) GitLab released 18.8.4 on Feb 10, 2026, addressing multiple issues, including API regressions and stability fixes in the GitLab REST/GraphQL interfaces. If your CI/CD system or automation tooling interacts with the GitLab API, updating to this patch will prevent unexpected failures in pipeline triggers and resource mutations. ( Reference ) Community Spotlight Matthew Reinbold: Focusing on What Actually Breaks in API Programs Matthew Reinboldʼs work is most valuable when you zoom in on what actually breaks once APIs move beyond the first few services. He focuses on portfolio-level failure modes, including version drift across domains, ambiguous ownership models, undocumented breaking changes, and inconsistent contract enforcement across distributed teams. A central theme in his writing is contract discipline. Reinbold repeatedly argues that API descriptions (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, event schemas) must function as enforceable contracts. Without automated linting, schema validation in CI/CD, and change-detection workflows, design standards erode quickly. What starts as governed becomes fragmented as multiple teams ship independently. He emphasizes design-first workflows, centralized style guides, and automated rule engines to prevent divergence before it spreads. He also highlights lifecycle rigor. APIs need explicit states with documented SLAs and change policies.

modern applications depend on large networks of third-party apis across multiple clouds and saas vendors. reliability engineering is expanding beyond internal services to include external api dependencies. failover strategies, traffic routing, and vendor diversification are becoming part of api platform design. observability and ownership must now extend across organizational and cloud boundaries. over the last decade, most reliability engineering practices focused on services teams directly controlled. organizations built redundancy across regions, introduced circuit breakers, and designed for graceful degradation within their own infrastructure. todays production systems rely heavily on third-party apis for payments, identity, communications, logistics, data enrichment, and ai services. these dependencies often span multiple vendors and cloud providers. as a result, reliability is no longer determined only by internal uptime. it is increasingly shaped by the availability and behavior of external apis. when an external dependency fails, they surface as a partial failure across workflows in forms of checkout flows that stall during payment authorization, onboarding flows that break during identity verification, or automated pipelines that fail when a data provider becomes unavailable. to manage this risk, platform teams are beginning to treat third-party apis as reliability domains that require the same engineering rigor as internal services. this includes formal dependency mapping, service-level objectives that incorporate external providers, and runbooks designed specifically for vendor outages. instead of assuming availability, teams are planning for degradation and recovery. traffic routing strategies are evolving as well. multi-vendor failover patterns are becoming more common, particularly in categories such as payments, messaging, and ai inference. systems are designed to switch providers when latency spikes or error rates exceed thresholds. this approach introduces new design challenges, including schema compatibility, consistent error handling, and data synchronization across providers. observability is expanding to support this broader scope. monitoring no longer focuses solely on internal metrics. it now includes external latency, rate-limit behavior, quota consumption, and vendor-specific error patterns. correlation across these signals helps teams understand whether failures originate inside their systems or within upstream dependencies. ownership boundaries are changing alongside these technical shifts. when critical workflows depend on external apis, responsibility cannot stop at the integration layer. teams must define escalation paths, maintain vendor communication channels, and incorporate third-party incidents into reliability planning. as api ecosystems continue to grow, resilience increasingly depends on how well organizations design for the reliability of services they do not control and ensure continuity when external dependencies inevitably fail. api feed gitguardian identifies the rapid growth of non-human identities nhis as a primary security challenge for 2026. as automation and ai agents proliferate, organizations are increasingly adopting graph-based approaches to map relationships between agents, secrets, and apis, highlighting the growing complexity of identity and secret management in api ecosystems.  reference  radware announced the acquisition of pynt, expanding its capabilities into full-lifecycle api security testing, from pre-production discovery and contract testing to runtime protection. this consolidation signals that api security tooling is becoming a core part of the application delivery portfolio.  reference  gitlab released 18.8.4 on feb 10, 2026, addressing multiple issues, including api regressions and stability fixes in the gitlab restgraphql interfaces. if your cicd system or automation tooling interacts with the gitlab api, updating to this patch will prevent unexpected failures in pipeline triggers and resource mutations.  reference  community spotlight matthew reinbold: focusing on what actually breaks in api programs matthew reinbolds work is most valuable when you zoom in on what actually breaks once apis move beyond the first few services. he focuses on portfolio-level failure modes, including version drift across domains, ambiguous ownership models, undocumented breaking changes, and inconsistent contract enforcement across distributed teams. a central theme in his writing is contract discipline. reinbold repeatedly argues that api descriptions openapi, asyncapi, event schemas must function as enforceable contracts. without automated linting, schema validation in cicd, and change-detection workflows, design standards erode quickly. what starts as governed becomes fragmented as multiple teams ship independently. he emphasizes design-first workflows, centralized style guides, and automated rule engines to prevent divergence before it spreads. he also highlights lifecycle rigor. apis need explicit states with documented slas and change policies. reinbold points out that many api programs lack structured deprecation governance, leading to zombie endpoints that persist for years. mature programs treat versioning strategy, backward compatibility testing, and consumer impact analysis as engineering responsibilities, not afterthoughts. on the operational side, he focuses heavily on observability and dependency mapping. once dozens of services depend on shared interfaces, understanding

suniel-shetty,"Many Indian careers don’t start with passion. A lot of them start with pressure. Pressure of finding that first job. In search of that hope that things are finally starting to fall into place. For so many people starting out, the early years are less about pursuing what we love and more about doing what makes sense. What feels feasible. What keeps things moving. There isn’t much room to be picky when expectations are riding on you. Parents who stretched themselves to educate you. Bills to pay. The simple understanding that things must work out. So choices become practical. Opportunities are taken up not because they are perfect, but because they are available or make sense. For many, the focus is less on passion and more on stability and momentum. At the time, it doesn’t feel strategic. It just feels necessary. But over the years, something interesting happens. That phase of figuring things out builds range. You start picking up skills you never planned for. Working across functions. Solving problems outside your actual role. Understanding how different parts of the system work. My early years were a lot like that in fact. I started out assuming my future was going to be in Dad’s restaurant business. So I studied hotel management to prepare. Those early years in the restaurant were totally different from what I expected. You do everything. There are no titles. No job is too small. That experience built an entrepreneurial drive in me which led me to retail and fashion. And when films eventually happened, the work ethic stayed. On a film set, I was never the filmstar. I was another professional doing his part, like every other technician. And that reputation has served me better than most of my successful films have. Indian professionals develop this adaptability early. Not because they planned for it. But because circumstances demanded it. Clarity usually comes later. Once there is stability. Once the pressure eases just a little. That’s when people begin choosing areas they want to go deeper in, and where they can truly excel. And when change shows up, a new role, a new industry, an unexpected turn, that adaptability becomes the advantage. There is no panic. No freezing. Just some quick adjustments.

travisbradberry,"What makes you happy at work? Maybe you have a great boss who gives you the freedom to be creative, rewards you for going the extra mile, and helps you to reach your career goals. Maybe you have none of the above and are updating your résumé as we speak. It’s pretty incredible how often you hear managers complaining about their best employees leaving, and they really do have something to complain about—few things are as costly and disruptive as good people walking out the door. But managers tend to blame their turnover problems on everything under the sun while ignoring the crux of the matter: people don’t leave jobs; they leave managers. Bad management does not discriminate based on salary or job title. A Fortune 500 executive team can experience more dissatisfaction and turnover than the baristas at a local coffee shop. The more demanding your job is and the less control you have over what you do, the more likely you are to suffer. A study by the American Psychological Association found that people whose work meets both these criteria are more likely to experience exhaustion, poor sleep, anxiety, and depression. The sad thing is that this suffering can easily be avoided. All that’s required is a new perspective and some extra effort on the manager’s part to give employees autonomy and make their work feel less demanding. To get there, managers must understand what they’re doing to kill morale. The following practices are the worst offenders, and they must be abolished if you’re going to hang on to good employees. #1 Overworking people. Nothing burns good employees out quite like overworking them. It’s so tempting to work the best people hard that managers frequently fall into this trap. Overworking good employees is perplexing for them as it makes them feel as if they’re being punished for their great performance. Overworking employees is also counterproductive. New research from Stanford showed that productivity per hour declines sharply when the workweek exceeds 50 hours, and productivity drops off so much after 55 hours that you don’t get anything out of working more. Talented employees will take on a bigger workload, but they won’t stay if their job suffocates them in the process. Raises, promotions, and title-changes are all acceptable ways to increase workload. If managers simply increase workload because people are talented, without changing a thing, these employees will seek another job that gives them what they deserve. #2 Holding people back. As an employee, y ou want to bring value to your job, and you do so with a unique set of skills and experience. So how is it that you can do your job so well that you become irreplaceable? This happens when managers sacrifice your upward mobility for their best interests. If you’re looking for your next career opportunity, and your boss is unwilling to let you move up the ladder, your enthusiasm is bound to wane. Taking away opportunities for advancement is a serious morale killer. Management may have a beginning, but it certainly has no end. When blessed with a talented employee, it’s the manager’s job to keep finding areas in which they can improve to expand their skill set and further their career. The most talented employees want feedback—more so than the less talented ones—and it’s a manager’s job to keep it coming. Otherwise, people grow bored and complacent. #3 Playing the blame game. A boss who is too proud to admit a mistake or who singles out individuals in front of the group creates a culture that is riddled with fear and anxiety. It’s impossible to bring your best to your work when you’re walking on eggshells. Instead of pointing fingers when something goes wrong, good managers work collaboratively with their team and focus on solutions. They pull people aside to discuss slip-ups instead of publicly shaming them, and they’re willing to accept responsibility for mistakes made under their leadership. #4 Frequent threats of firing. Some managers use threats of termination to keep you in line and to scare you into performing better. This is a lazy and shortsighted way of motivating people. People who feel disposable are quick to find another job where they’ll be valued and will receive the respect that they deserve. #5 Not letting people pursue their passions. Talented employees are passionate. Providing opportunities for them to pursue their passions improves their productivity and job satisfaction, but many managers want people to work within a little box. These managers fear that productivity will decline if they let people expand their focus and pursue their passions. This fear is unfounded. Studies have shown that people who are able to pursue their passions at work experience flow , a euphoric state of mind that is five times more productive than the norm. #6 Withholding praise. It’s easy to underestimate the power of a pat on the back, especially with top performers who are intrinsically motivated. Everyone likes kudos, none more so than those who work hard and give their all. Managers need to communicate with their people to find out what makes them feel good (for some, it’s a raise; for others, it’s public recognition) and then to reward them for a job well done. With top performers, this will happen often if you’re doing it right. This doesn’t mean that managers need to praise people for showing up on time or working an eight-hour day—these things are the price of entry—but a boss who does not give praise to dedicated employees erodes their commitment to the job. Moving Forward If managers want their best people to stay, they need to think carefully about how they treat them. While good employees are as tough as nails, their talent gives them an abundance of options. Managers need to make people want to work for them. What other mistakes kill morale?

samuele-giampieri-b1b67597,"3 weeks ago I open-sourced an AI that performs full penetration tests autonomously. I didn't expect this level of interest, I received many messages and suggestions from pentesters and and cybersecurity professionals asking for more features, better usability, and more control over the agent's behavior. Today I'm releasing #RedAmon v1.1.0. 📦 GitHub (100% Free): https://lnkd.in/dVHiq4sC 🎬 Video Tutorial: https://lnkd.in/dS-GpVVV 📄 Research Paper (Inspiration): https://lnkd.in/dc8Apu5w 🤖 Try It with Claude Opus 4.6!!! Compared to GPT 5.1, Opus 4.6 reaches successful exploits in ~30% fewer steps and in post-exploitation it crafts complex multi-stage commands for privilege escalation and lateral movement that would take a human operator much longer to write. Here's what changed: 🧠 The Agent Now Thinks in Attack Paths v1.0 had a single exploitation flow. v1.1.0 introduces dynamic attack path selection: → CVE Exploit Path, the agent finds a vulnerable service, searches for the right Metasploit module, configures the payload, and fires. Fully autonomous. → Brute Force Path, picks the right wordlist, attacks SSH/FTP/MySQL, rotates credentials. Configurable max attempts per service. The agent decides which path to take based on what it finds in the graph. More attack paths coming soon... 🎮 You Can Now Steer the AI Mid-Attack This was the #1 request from the community: → Live Guidance, send messages like ""Focus on port 22, ignore web apps"" while the agent is working. It reads your message before its next reasoning step. → Stop, pause execution at any point. State is checkpointed. → Resume, continue from exactly where you stopped. Full context preserved. ⚙️ 180+ Settings. Zero Config Files. Every tool parameter is now configurable from the webapp UI: → Naabu thread count, scan type, CDN exclusion → Nuclei severity filters, DAST mode, template selection → Katana crawl depth, JS rendering, scope control → Agent model selection, max iterations, approval gates → Brute force limits, payload types, custom system prompts No more YAML. No more rebuilding containers. Create a project, tweak the sliders, hit scan. One Command to Rule Them All docker compose up -d That's it. All 7 services. One file. Dev mode included with hot-reload. 💬 The Chat Got a Serious Upgrade → Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting → Smart auto-scroll (doesn't jump when you're reading) → Real-time Metasploit progress streaming (see exploit output as it happens) v1.0 proved the concept. v1.1.0 makes it usable. Next up: GVM/OpenVAS integration (170,000+ network vulnerability tests) and GitHub secret hunting. Star the repo if you want to follow along.

reidhoffman,"From every credible industry-wide conversation I’ve had — with CEOs, operators, economists, and technologists who aren’t trying to generate outrage — there is no clear evidence yet that AI is driving the bulk of these announcements and intended layoffs. In fact, the data suggests most companies haven’t yet experienced major efficiencies because of mass AI adoptions. That doesn’t mean AI won’t reshape work. It already is in small ways. But the data does not support the narrative that this current wave is mass AI job replacement. So what’s actually happening? The first explanation is less cinematic but more real: companies are still refactoring from COVID and an environment of ultra-low interest rates. During the pandemic, many organizations overhired. In the years following, entire divisions were built for conditions and experiments that didn’t pan out. Now we’re seeing that unwind. When companies refactor, it shows up as layoffs — especially at entry levels. What most companies are really doing is playing the narrative game well. We’re also in an “AI scapegoat” moment. To markets and investors, layoffs usually read as: something is wrong. But if you can pin the layoff on AI, the story flips to something going “right,” or “we’re strong,” “we’re upgrading,” and “we’re ahead of the curve.” It’s a reputational hack that allows companies to reframe their workforce decisions as steps forward, not backwards. It gives investors a progress storyline, gives the media a dramatic frame (“humans vs. machines”), and gives leaders cover to make cuts without looking like the business is wobbling. Sometimes AI is genuinely part of the efficiency gain — but very often, “AI layoffs” is the label slapped on a much messier mix of post-COVID overhiring, policy volatility, and normal corporate refactoring. We should be clear-eyed about what’s actually happening, though. Sustained-reasoning agents, advanced coding copilots, and autonomous workflow systems are here. The agent era isn’t speculative anymore. That kind of capability doesn’t eliminate knowledge work. It amplifies it; which means our central challenge is transition. Questions like: “How do we help individuals upgrade their skills fast enough to stay on the right side of leverage?” And “how might companies redesign roles so talent is redeployed, not discarded?” These are not abstract debates. They’re structural questions about how we manage abundance without creating instability. And they require deliberate leadership from business, education, and government alike.

serenalamau,"Last CNY 🧧, someone told me Fuzzy was ""𝐥𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐲"" to have zero churn among the customers we were genuinely the right solution for. I nearly spat out my dumpling. Lucky? We literally said no to paying customers because they weren't the right fit. We walked away from revenue. On purpose. Multiple times. That's not luck. That's conviction, even when the easier path was just to take the money. But here's what happened when we stopped chasing every deal and started being really picky: The right customers stayed. They expanded. They referred others. No discounting, no awkward ""just checking in"" follow-ups. And funny enough, our best customers do the exact same thing. They don't try to shortcut their way to trust. They actually want to get to know the people they're selling to. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how rare that is.

ankit-pangasa,"Learn Sharding vs Consistent Hashing in 5 Minutes (Interview Must-Know) ⏱️ If you’ve prepared for system design interviews, you’ve definitely seen this question: “What would you use Sharding or Consistent Hashing?” And this is where many candidates confuse architecture with algorithms. Let’s fix that in 5 minutes. 🔹 1️⃣ Sharding (Think: Splitting the Database) Sharding = Horizontal partitioning of data Instead of one big database: Shard 1 → Users 1–1M Shard 2 → Users 1M–2M Shard 3 → Users 2M–3M ✅ Why we shard: Scale writes Improve performance Reduce load on a single machine Handle massive datasets 📌 Common strategies: Range-based (UserID 1–1000) Hash-based (hash(user_id) % N) Geographic-based Directory-based ⚠️ The catch? If you add a new shard, you often need heavy data rebalancing. That’s an important interview talking point. 🔹 2️⃣ Consistent Hashing (Think: Smart Distribution) Consistent hashing is not sharding. It’s a data distribution algorithm used in distributed systems. Instead of: hash(key) % N It: Places servers on a hash ring Places keys on the same ring Assigns each key to the next clockwise server 🔥 Why it’s powerful: Add a server → Only nearby keys move Remove a server → Only neighboring keys remap Minimal rebalancing That’s why it’s widely used in: Distributed caches Dynamic clusters Systems like Cassandra, Dynamo, Redis 🎯 The Key Interview Difference Sharding = Architecture pattern 👉 “We split the database to scale.” Consistent Hashing = Distribution technique 👉 “We efficiently map keys to nodes with minimal movement.” Sharding answers: How do we scale storage? Consistent hashing answers: How do we distribute keys efficiently when nodes change? 🧠 30-Second Interview Answer Sharding is horizontal partitioning of data across multiple databases to achieve scalability. Consistent hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to map keys to nodes while minimizing data movement when nodes are added or removed. Clear. Structured. Strong signal. In real large-scale systems (Uber, Netflix, etc.), you often use both together. They complement each other. They are not interchangeable.

reidhoffman,"In many ways, AI is like a calculator or a pen; a tool someone can use to expand their capabilities and perform tasks faster. But Parth sees AI differently: not as a new tool or feature, but as a complete extension of every capability he has as a human. To really start leveraging AI, you have to ask yourself “can AI upgrade this process” almost every time you’re faced with a question or challenge. Learning 1: Seeing AI as a meta tool. When you can describe what you’re trying to do in natural language, and the AI system can respond with explanations, plans, drafts, critiques, and increasingly actions, you stop “using software” and start pointing raw intelligence at problems. The old model of computing was: learn the tool, then do the work. The new model is: describe the work, and the tool helps you learn what you need along the way. That’s why Parth calls ChatGPT a kind of “meta tool”, the tool you use to basically learn or wield any other tool. He framed it in a way that I think will become increasingly normal: ChatGPT becomes the starting point not because it does one thing best, but because it can teach you how to do everything better. “Teach me how to use my computer.” “Teach me this editing workflow.” “Teach me this analytics tool.” “Teach me how to set up this process.” The way to unlock this mindset, according to Parth, is to ask yourself “can AI help me” more often than you think. That’s because the value AI brings to you compounds: As you ask more questions, you get better at asking. You realize you should ask it to help you do more things. The model gets better at helping. When you see it this way, AI isn’t just a faster way to do the same tasks. It’s a faster way to become the kind of person who can do new tasks. Leverage on your ability to learn. Learning 2: Get better at speaking to AI. If AI is a new computer, prompting is a form of literacy. Parth’s advice, though, wasn’t how to type better prompts but to throw the keyboard out all together, and start talking to your AI. The reason is simple: most people type in a structured, polished manner. Voice is different. You can ramble for five or ten minutes, dump messy context, say the half-formed thing, contradict yourself, circle back. And what’s counterintuitive is: that often produces better outputs, because the model has more material to work with. You’re not compressing your thinking too early. Parth also talked about role prompting, which I believe is one of the most powerful ways to escape your own blind spots. Ask the model to be the skeptical investor or the first time customer. Talk to it, and ask it to pick apart your thinking. You’re not pretending it’s a real person; you’re using it to surface perspectives you’d otherwise miss. Then there’s the move I loved most: “Interview me until you have enough context, then we’ll begin.” That’s what a good colleague does. If you let AI pull assumptions out of you and force you to define the constraints, you often discover you were solving the wrong problem. Learning 3: Once you’ve mastered one agent, deploy dozens. The third theme was where the conversation moved from “useful” to “the future is already here.” Parth isn’t only using a single assistant. He’s orchestrating multiple agents at once—Claude, Codex, Gemini—each running in parallel on different objectives inside the same project, talking to each other. One reviews mobile UX, while another pulls analytics. One reads prior writing and proposes future topics. This is a very different idea of work. It’s less like “I have a helpful chatbot” and more like “I have a small team that can run without me.” It also comes with real challenges, and Parth’s examples were instructive. Early multi-agent experiments devolved into agents thanking each other in infinite loops. Sometimes there are massive coordination problems or agents decide to work on the wrong things. If one agent can “approve” another agent’s access, you’ve accidentally built a loophole that breaks the meaning of a sandbox. Getting to this level of agentic coordination (setting it up is still difficult, coordinating them is another ballgame) is not something everyone should strive to do. Modeling it in some scenarios, though, can be helpful. What are the tasks you’re using AI to do right now that with one or two more agents can be completely automated? How do you build the “multi-agent” muscle as AI gets better and dozens of co-pilots become more accessible? I learned a ton from my conversation with Parth. It reshaped how I’m thinking about what it means to actually become AI-native, not just “use AI.” I’m already looking forward to the next one.

dr-ian-chew-b15b64aa,"I grew up actively watching university rankings. Like many students across Asia, I remember checking Times Higher Education tables, watching which institutions moved up or down, and wondering what truly drives global academic impact. In 2026, I’ll be speaking at the Times Higher Education Global Sustainable Development Congress in Jakarta: no longer as a watcher of such rankings, but as someone contributing to how universities can strategically improve them. This year's edition is slated to gather over 5,000 global leaders to accelerate progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 🗓 12:30–13:00 Digital carbon as the next sustainability frontier: How universities can rapidly improve impact, rankings, and scale For years, universities have made impressive progress in physical sustainability: • Green buildings • Renewable energy • Waste reduction But there is one material lever that remains largely invisible in sustainability agendas and reporting: 👉 Digital carbon emissions Universities now operate vast digital estates: websites, research platforms, cloud systems, online learning environments, AI infrastructure. Yet most sustainability strategies and global rankings barely account for the emissions embedded in digital operations. This is the hidden sweet spot. Digital carbon emission is: • Measurable • Scalable • Rapid to implement • Low-cost compared to infrastructure retrofits • Directly integrable into governance, curriculum, and research In this keynote, I’ll outline: • Why digital carbon is the missing pillar in university sustainability • How low-carbon computer code can reduce emissions without new infrastructure investment • How institutions can integrate digital sustainability into governance, teaching, research, and operations • How this creates both real-world impact and measurable ranking advantages As someone working at the intersection of digital systems, sustainability strategy, and institutional transformation, I believe this is one of the most underutilised levers in higher education today. Universities don’t need another decade-long masterplan to move the needle. They need smart, digital-first sustainability integration.

rushika-rai-a58345254,"Short-term replies are easy. Long-term intelligence is the hard part. Anyone can wire up a chatbot that remembers the last few messages. Very few build systems that remember what actually matters over time. If you want AI that improves instead of resets, you need layered memory. Here are the core memory types that shape real LLM applications: 1️⃣ Session Memory Holds recent conversation and temporary context. Perfect for chat and short workflows, but it disappears once the session ends and is capped by the context window. 2️⃣ Persistent Text Memory Stores past chats, notes, and summaries. Great for assistants that need continuity, though retrieval can get messy at scale without structure. 3️⃣ Vector (Semantic) Memory Stores embeddings for similarity search. The engine behind RAG systems - scalable, flexible, and powerful when chunking and filtering are done right. 4️⃣ Structured Memory Stores facts, entities, user preferences, and schemas. Best for high-precision use cases like profiles, transactions, and enterprise workflows. 5️⃣ Episodic Memory Captures time-ordered actions and outcomes. Allows agents to reflect, adjust behavior, and learn from past interactions. 6️⃣ Knowledge Graph Memory Connects entities through relationships. Enables deeper reasoning and long-horizon planning, but requires thoughtful design. Here’s the shift: Session memory makes your AI responsive. Vector memory makes it informed. Structured memory makes it dependable. Episodic memory makes it adaptive. Knowledge graphs make it strategic. If your system forgets everything after each prompt, it’s not intelligent yet. It’s just reactive. What kind of memory is your AI actually using today? Courses You Must Explore 1. Python for Everybody – University of Michigan: https://lnkd.in/gVPha9EE 2.

sagarpandeysp,"Do you know which tools turn a chatbot into a real system? A chatbot becomes a product only when it’s surrounded by the right infrastructure. Models generate text. Systems deliver value. Here’s what actually makes the shift happen: 🧠 Model Layer OpenAI API – Provides advanced language and reasoning capabilities that power intelligent responses. 📚 Retrieval Layer LlamaIndex – Connects enterprise documents, APIs, and structured data for context-aware answers. Pinecone / Weaviate / Chroma – Vector databases that store embeddings and enable fast semantic search. 🔄 Agent Frameworks LangChain – Designs tool-using agents with memory and workflow logic. CrewAI / AutoGen – Coordinate multiple agents to collaborate on complex tasks. ⚡ API & Serving FastAPI – Turns your agent into a production-grade API. Redis – Handles caching, sessions, and short-term memory efficiently. 📦 Infrastructure & Scaling Docker – Ensures consistent deployments across environments. Kubernetes – Scales containerized AI workloads reliably in the cloud. Here’s the shift: A chatbot answers questions. A real system retrieves knowledge, manages memory, orchestrates actions, scales under load, and integrates with business workflows. That’s the difference between a demo… and a product.

ariadi,"At the recent TM Forum Tour Tokyo, I had the pleasure of joining a fireside chat with TM Forum CTO George Glass to discuss a topic that continues to generate both excitement and confusion across the telecom industry: Autonomous Networks and enterprise-scale AI adoption. The conversation confirmed something important: AI in telecom is no longer about experimentation: the opportunity to create real, measurable value is already here. But realizing that value requires focus and discipline. This report captures the key insights and strategic guidance from that discussion, offering telecom operators and technology leaders a practical roadmap for moving from AI pilots to systematic, value-creating autonomous network operations. Telcos Have Real AI Value Opportunities — Not Just Pilots Many operators remain trapped in an endless cycle of proof-of-concepts and fragmented AI initiatives, uncertain about where real value lies. Yet the opportunity landscape is remarkably tangible and well-defined. The telecommunications industry now has clear, proven use cases where artificial intelligence delivers measurable operational and financial returns. Network optimization and predictive operations enable operators to anticipate congestion, prevent outages, and dynamically allocate resources before customer experience degrades. Intelligent assurance and incident prevention transform reactive firefighting into proactive health management, reducing significant mean time to resolution in leading deployments. Automated service operations eliminate manual toil in provisioning, configuration, and activation workflows, freeing engineering talent for higher-value innovation work. Proactive customer experience management uses behavioral signals and network telemetry to identify at-risk subscribers before they contact support or churn. Closed-loop decisioning brings these capabilities together into autonomous systems that sense, decide, and act without human intervention. The fundamental differentiator in today's competitive landscape is no longer whether AI is used, but how systematically it is deployed, integrated, and scaled across the operational technology stack. Fragmented point solutions deliver marginal gains. Systematic platforms deliver transformational impact. Key Value Domains Network optimization and predictive operations Intelligent assurance and incident prevention Automated service operations Proactive customer experience management Closed-loop decisioning The differentiator is no longer whether AI is used, but how systematically it is deployed and scaled. The Barriers Are Real, But No Longer Blocking During our fireside chat, we addressed the elephant in the room: the very real obstacles that have historically slowed AI adoption in telecommunications. These challenges are significant, well-documented, and shared across operators globally. Acknowledging them openly is the first step toward systematic resolution. Fragmented and Inconsistent Data Sources. Network telemetry, customer data, operational logs, and service inventory reside in incompatible formats across disconnected repositories. Data quality issues compound the problem, with inconsistent schemas and missing context. Legacy Platforms and Siloed Architectures. Decades of organic growth have created architectural complexity that resists integration. OSS and BSS systems operate as independent kingdoms, making end-to-end orchestration extraordinarily difficult. Weak Data Engineering Foundations. Many operators lack the data pipelines, governance frameworks, and engineering discipline required to feed AI systems reliably. Without strong foundations, even sophisticated models fail in production. Integration Complexity Across OSS/BSS Stacks. Connecting AI capabilities to legacy fulfillment, provisioning, and billing systems requires extensive custom integration work. API maturity varies wildly across vendors and platforms. Disconnected AI Initiatives Across Domains. Marketing runs customer churn models. Network operations deploys predictive maintenance. Service assurance experiments with anomaly detection. Each team works independently, duplicating infrastructure and missing synergies. The crucial insight from Tokyo: these barriers are real, but they are no longer blocking. Solutions have moved from theoretical research to proven implementation patterns. Reference architectures, maturity assessment frameworks, and vendor ecosystems now exist to guide systematic modernization. The industry has shifted from exploration to structured execution, and operators who recognize this shift are accelerating past their competitors. Autonomous Network Level 4 Framework as Practical Guidance TM Forum's Autonomous Network Level 4 framework provides the telecommunications industry with something it desperately needed: a practical maturity model and clearly defined target state that operators can use as a north star for their transformation journeys. This framework translates abstract aspirations about ""network autonomy"" into concrete, measurable capabilities and architectural requirements. The framework answers the critical questions that CTOs and engineering leaders struggle with daily. What does autonomy actually mean in operational terms, beyond marketing buzzwords? Which foundational capabilities must exist before attempting closed-loop automation? How do we measure progress objectively across diverse network domains and operational contexts? How do we move systematically from assisted operations to genuinely autonomous systems? Frameworks matter significantly because they transform ambitious vision into executable roadmaps. They provide the common language that aligns executive sponsors, engineering teams, and vendor ecosystems. They enable operators to make informed investment decisions, prioritize capability development, and avoid costly reworks. The Autonomous Network Level 4 framework represents years of collaborative industry work distilled into actionable guidance, and smart operators are using it to accelerate their journeys with confidence and clarity. Three Priorities for Telco CTOs to Scale AI For CTOs and technology leaders committed to scaling artificial intelligence across telecommunications operations, success requires moving beyond the pilot mentality. Launching more proofs-of-concept will not create transformational value. What matters now is building the right foundational capabilities and making disciplined choices about where to focus limited resources and organizational energy. 1. Fix the Basics: Strengthen Data and Integration Foundations AI cannot scale on weak plumbing. Before deploying sophisticated machine learning models, operators must invest in unglamorous but essential data engineering work. This means improving data quality through governance and validation pipelines. It means modernizing legacy integrations with API-first architectures and event-driven patterns. It means building reliable data platforms that can ingest, transform, and serve the massive volumes of network and operational telemetry that AI systems require. Without these foundations, even the most advanced algorithms will fail in production, i.e. starved of the clean, timely, contextual data they need to generate accurate insights and drive automated decisions. 2. Assess AI Adoption Readiness Across Multiple Dimensions Readiness assessment must extend far beyond technology evaluation. Yes, operators need to audit their model development capabilities, MLOps maturity, and infrastructure for training and inference. But equally critical are organizational readiness factors: does the culture support data-driven decision-making? Are business and technology teams aligned on priorities and success metrics? Do processes exist for model governance, bias monitoring, and ethical AI practices? Architectural readiness matters too: can existing systems expose the interfaces and consume the outputs that AI applications require? A comprehensive readiness assessment identifies gaps across all these dimensions and sequences remediation work appropriately. 3. Prioritize High-Value Use Cases with Ruthless Selectivity The temptation to pursue every interesting AI use case must be resisted. CTOs should establish clear criteria for use case selection: measurable operational or financial impact, feasibility given current capabilities, strategic alignment with business objectives, and potential for scaling success across multiple domains. Focus intensely on the highest-value opportunities, i.e. those that can move key performance indicators meaningfully. Invest fully in making those use cases successful: excellent data, strong engineering, robust operations, and effective change management. Scale what works through reusable platforms and patterns. Stop what doesn't work quickly, learn from the failure, and reallocate resources. Breadth without depth delivers nothing. Depth in the right areas delivers transformation. Scaling AI is not about launching more pilots. It is about building the right foundations and making disciplined choices. The Path Forward: From Vision to Engineering Reality Autonomous networks have crossed a critical threshold. They are no longer a distant future vision reserved for industry roadmaps and vendor whitepapers. They represent an achievable engineering and operating model, one that forward-thinking operators are implementing today with measurable results. The telecommunications industry stands at an inflection point. The technical solutions, architectural patterns, and maturity frameworks needed for systematic AI adoption now exist. The use cases with proven ROI have been identified and validated across multiple operators. What remains is execution: the disciplined work of aligning architecture, strengthening data foundations, and building organizational capabilities. For operators willing to commit to that disciplined execution, the rewards are substantial. Reduced operational costs through automation. Improved customer experience through proactive service management. Faster innovation cycles through intelligent orchestration. Competitive differentiation through capabilities that cannot be easily replicated. These benefits compound over time as autonomous capabilities mature and extend across more network domains and operational processes. The future of autonomous networks is being built today, by operators who recognize that AI excellence requires not just advanced technology, but architectural modernization, data engineering discipline, and organizational alignment. The opportunity is here. The question is who will seize it most effectively.",35.0,3.0,10,,1225,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],10670,10668,1392,1391,101,8,0,0,"at the recent tm forum tour tokyo, i had the pleasure of

rathanuday,"Why simple AI systems scale better Complexity feels impressive. Simplicity performs. Here’s what actually happens when you keep AI systems lean: 1️⃣ Reduced System Complexity Clear architecture, fewer dependencies, and minimal integrations mean fewer failure points. Debugging is faster. Onboarding is easier. Behavior becomes predictable. 2️⃣ Faster Deployment Cycles Shorter builds and streamlined workflows remove friction. You test quickly, release confidently, and iterate without waiting on layers of approvals. 3️⃣ Better Team Adoption Simple tools lower resistance. Clear workflows build trust. Cross-team usage increases because people understand what the system is doing. 4️⃣ Lower Operational Costs Smaller infrastructure, fewer licenses, and optimized compute keep costs stable. Maintenance becomes efficient instead of reactive. 5️⃣ Higher Reliability Fewer moving parts reduce drift and unexpected failures. Outputs stay stable. Scaling becomes predictable. 6️⃣ Easier Maintenance & Monitoring Clean logs. Clear metrics. Controlled updates. When something breaks, you fix it fast - without digging through a maze. Scaling AI isn’t about stacking more components. It’s about removing what you don’t need. The systems that last are not the most complex. They’re the most disciplined.

For me, it has sparked some of the most energising conversations I’ve had in recent years, with technology partners, industry leaders and our own teams, as we explore and implement what it takes to build an AI-First Telco of the Future. These conversations matter. They shape strategy, investment and capability. But too often, they happen behind closed doors. Podcasts are changing that. Over the years, I’ve joined many to discuss digital transformation, culture and emerging technologies, and I’ve always valued how they open up complex topics – creating space not just for experts, but for anyone curious about where technology is heading. Now, at Singtel – a company with more than 145 years of experience built on collaboration, innovation and resilience – it felt like the right time to create a platform of our own. A place to share what we’re seeing, learning and building, and to have honest conversations about what truly matters to industry and business leaders. That’s what inspired the TChats: Building the Future series. (also a little play on my name 😊 ) This is a first for me: not just joining the conversation but hosting it. In each episode, I’ll be sitting down with industry partners, technology leaders and Singtel veterans to exchange perspectives on the technologies and trends shaping our world. We’ve designed the episodes to be concise and focused – because we know how full everyone’s calendars already are. Our first episode is now live and looks at the evolution of network technology and how modern, intelligent networks are transforming industries in powerful and positive ways.

ariadi,"With over twenty years in Indonesia's fast-changing technology scene, I've seen firsthand how AI is changing things. This look at AI will cover how it's being used in big industries like banking, mobile services, and business advice, pointing out both what's working well and the challenges we still face. Indonesia is a country of many islands with a growing digital economy, making it a special place for AI to grow. A lot of people use mobile internet, the population is young and good with technology, and there are many new tech companies. This environment has helped digital services spread quickly, creating tons of data that AI needs to learn and improve. In the banking sector, AI is increasingly used to spot fraud, check risks, and offer personal help to customers using smart chat programs and suggestions. Banks are using machine learning to understand how people spend money, which helps stop financial crime and makes things more secure. Similarly, the mobile services industry uses AI to make networks work better, fix problems before they happen, and guess when customers might leave. This helps them offer more reliable services and tailor plans to what each person needs. For consulting companies, AI has become a vital tool for looking at data, understanding the market, and giving smart advice to clients in many different areas. Being able to quickly understand huge amounts of data helps these companies give better and more effective advice, making businesses more efficient and competitive. ""Having navigated Indonesia's dynamic tech landscape for over two decades, I've seen AI evolve from a nascent concept to a transformative force, revolutionizing banking, mobile services, and consulting. The journey has just begun, and the opportunities for AI to reshape our industries and empower every corner of this archipelago are truly immense."" However, this journey isn't easy. We face challenges like a shortage of skilled AI and data experts, limited digital services in remote areas, worries about data privacy, and the need for clear rules on how to use AI fairly. Despite these challenges, the chances for growth are huge, thanks to a large local market and strong support from the government. Government plans like ""Making Indonesia 4.0"" and the National AI Strategy show that the country is serious about developing AI. What makes Indonesia's AI story special is its mix of quick mobile adoption, a diverse culture that leads to unique AI uses, and the need to connect people across different places. This makes AI a tool for national growth and bringing everyone along, not just for making businesses more efficient. In summary, Indonesia is at the forefront of adopting AI, driven by its digital-savvy population and supportive government. While addressing challenges in talent and infrastructure is crucial, the potential for AI to drive economic growth, improve services, and connect communities across this diverse nation is immense.

ariadi,"As we are approaching the end of 2025, the conversation around Artificial Intelligence has evolved from emerging curiosity to strategic imperative. This article, reflecting on McKinsey's ""State of AI in 2025"" report, offers an analytical look at the current landscape of AI adoption within enterprises delving into the critical juncture where broad enthusiasm meets the tangible challenges of scaling AI from pilot projects to enterprise-wide transformation. The objective is to illuminate not only the significant progress made but also the persistent gaps that distinguish leading organisations from those still grappling with foundational implementation. This reflection looks into the perspective on AI strategy and adoption, offering insights into value realisation, the characteristics of high-performing AI adopters, and the evolving workforce implications. The Broadening Horizon of AI Adoption The ""State of AI in 2025"" report by McKinsey offers a sobering perspective on the actual progress of enterprise-wide AI scaling. While the enthusiasm for AI continues to dominate boardroom discussions, the reality on the ground reveals a significant disparity between experimentation and tangible, widespread integration. The majority of AI projects are yet to transition from proof-of-concept stages to fully scaled applications that fundamentally redefine business operations. Fewer than 1 in 10 organisations have successfully scaled AI agents across any function. This indicates that while many are dipping their toes into the AI waters, very few are swimming confidently at depth. Industries such as technology, media & telecommunications, and healthcare are currently at the forefront of early adoption, showcasing a better readiness to move beyond initial experiments. Moreover, larger enterprises generally exhibit a superior capacity to scale AI initiatives beyond mere pilot programmes, leveraging greater resources and established infrastructures. AI's Value: Real, Yet Unevenly Distributed The impact of Artificial Intelligence on business outcomes is undoubtedly real, with organisations reporting tangible benefits. However, the nature of these benefits varies significantly depending on the functional area where AI is deployed. This uneven distribution highlights AI's multifaceted utility as both a cost-efficiency driver and a growth engine. Beyond the direct financial implications, organisations are also realising significant value in broader strategic areas. AI is proving to be a catalyst for enhanced innovation, fostering the creation of novel solutions and business models. It also plays a crucial role in improving both employee and customer satisfaction through streamlined processes and personalised interactions. Furthermore, the strategic deployment of AI is a key driver for competitive differentiation, allowing businesses to carve out unique advantages in increasingly crowded markets. The overarching message is clear: AI has transcended its initial perception as merely a cost-saving tool and has firmly established itself as a powerful strategic lever for sustainable growth and market leadership. Beyond Cost & Revenue: Broader Value Creation While AI's direct impact on cost efficiency and revenue generation is significant, its true strategic value extends far beyond these traditional metrics. Organisations are increasingly recognising AI as a fundamental catalyst for fostering innovation, enhancing stakeholder satisfaction, and securing a distinct competitive edge in the market. This broader value creation positions AI not just as a technological enhancement, but as a core component of future-proofing business models. Innovation Acceleration : AI acts as an accelerant for innovation, empowering organisations to rapidly prototype, test, and deploy new products, services, and business models. It provides insights that fuel creativity and enables more agile development cycles. Employee & Customer Satisfaction : By automating mundane tasks and personalising interactions, AI significantly boosts both employee engagement and customer loyalty. This creates a more efficient and human-centric experience across the board. Competitive Differentiation : Strategic AI implementation enables businesses to develop unique capabilities and offerings that set them apart from rivals. This can manifest as superior operational efficiency, enhanced customer insights, or entirely new market propositions. These broader benefits underscore a fundamental shift in how AI is perceived within the enterprise. It is no longer merely a tool for optimising existing processes but a strategic enabler for creating entirely new forms of value. Organisations that embrace this holistic view of AI are better positioned to leverage its full potential and secure long-term success in an increasingly AI-driven global economy. What the 'High Performers' Do Differently McKinsey's report highlights a widening gap between typical organisations and the group of 'AI high performers', those who are consistently achieving significant returns from their AI investments. These high performers distinguish themselves not just through technological adoption, but through an intense and integrated approach to AI strategy and implementation. In essence, while technology forms the bedrock, it is the disciplined execution of an evolved operating model that truly sets high performers apart. Their success is a testament to the principle that strategic vision, organisational agility, and unwavering leadership are critical in maximising the transformative power of AI. The Workforce in Transition: Expectations vs. Reality As AI continues its trajectory of integration into enterprise operations, workforce expectations are undergoing a significant shift. Organizations anticipate more substantial AI-driven impacts on employment in the coming year, a notable increase compared to observed changes in the past year. This dual perspective encompasses both potential job reductions and the creation of new roles, painting a complex picture for human capital strategy. Larger organisations are demonstrating a greater tendency to report AI-driven hiring, indicating that the scale of operations may facilitate the creation of specialised AI-related roles. Expectations regarding workforce size adjustments vary considerably across different functional areas, reflecting the uneven impact of AI automation and augmentation. However, with increased AI adoption comes a heightened awareness of its associated risks. The most commonly reported concern is the issue of inaccurate AI outputs. This critical challenge is prompting organisations to place a significant emphasis on robust mitigation strategies and comprehensive governance frameworks. The imperative for accurate and reliable AI systems underscores the need for meticulous data management, rigorous model validation, and continuous monitoring. This evolving landscape firmly reinforces the critical need for robust AI governance, the establishment of responsible AI practices, and proactive skill transformation strategies. To navigate these changes successfully, organisations must invest in upskilling and reskilling their workforce, ensuring that human capabilities evolve in tandem with AI advancements. AI Governance and Responsible AI: Mitigating Risks The widespread concern surrounding inaccurate AI outputs underscores a critical mandate for organisations: the establishment of robust AI governance and responsible AI practices. As AI systems become more integral to core business functions, ensuring their reliability, fairness, and transparency is not merely a regulatory compliance issue, but a strategic imperative to maintain trust and avoid significant operational disruptions. Beyond technical safeguards, responsible AI encompasses ethical considerations, including fairness, privacy, and societal impact. Organisations must proactively address potential biases in AI algorithms, safeguard sensitive data, and evaluate the broader implications of AI deployment. This holistic approach to AI governance and responsibility is essential for building sustainable AI capabilities that deliver consistent value while upholding ethical standards. The Midpoint of AI Adoption: 2025's Landscape As we progress through 2025, the landscape of AI adoption presents a fascinating midpoint - a convergence of widespread enthusiasm and emergent challenges. The McKinsey report articulates this delicate balance, revealing a scenario where the potential of AI is widely acknowledged, yet its full realisation remains a journey for most enterprises. Yet 2025 is a pivotal year. The foundational pieces for AI adoption are in place, but the challenge now shifts from 'why' to 'how' to scale effectively. Organisations face a dual mandate: harnessing the clear benefits of AI while simultaneously addressing the growing concerns around accuracy and risk. The strategic winners will be those who can bridge this gap, transforming experimentation into sustained, impactful AI-driven growth. Closing the Gap: From Pilots to Pervasive AI The central challenge for most organisations in 2026 and beyond is no longer whether to adopt AI, but rather how to effectively bridge the gap between pilot programmes and meaningful, enterprise-wide scale. This transition demands a fundamental shift in perspective, viewing AI not as a mere technological upgrade, but as an overarching enterprise transformation journey. The organisations determined to lead the next wave of AI adoption are those that holistically embrace this transformation. They understand that AI's success is intrinsically linked to a supportive organisational culture, agile operating models, and a workforce equipped with the necessary skills to collaborate effectively with intelligent systems. The race is now to accelerate this transition, converting promising experiments into widespread operational excellence and strategic advantage. The Imperative for Enterprise-Wide Transformation The insights portray a pivotal truth: successful AI adoption is not merely a technological implementation, but an enterprise-wide transformation. Organisations that view AI through this lens - as a catalyst for fundamental change across people, processes, and technology - are the ones that will truly unlock its expansive potential. The question for many organisations is no longer 'Should we adopt AI?' It's 'How fast can we close the gap between pilots and meaningful scale?' This shift in questioning signifies a maturation in the approach to AI. It underscores that the current challenge lies in operationalising AI at scale, integrating it deeply into the fabric of the business rather than treating it as a peripheral experiment. The leading enterprises will be those characterised by: The AI journey demands decisive action. Leaders must champion this transformation, embedding AI into every layer of decision-making and operation. The future belongs to those who can master not just the technology of AI, but the art of enterprise-wide adaptation and execution.

vrungta,"𝗧𝗵𝗲 Claude Code 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 We are currently witnessing a structural shift in how LLM applications are built. We have moved from Chatbots (stateless Q&A) to Workflows (code-driven DAGs like n8n), and are now arriving at Autonomous Agents (model-driven loops). Claude Code is the first mass-market example of this ""System 2"" architecture. I spent the weekend reverse-engineering its design. Here are the 6 architectural shifts that matter: 1. 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗟𝗼𝗼𝗽𝘀: In a workflow, code controls the model. In an agent, the model controls the loop (Think → Act → Observe). The runtime is dumb; the model is the CEO. 2. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗕𝗼𝗱𝘆: The AI isn't just a prompt. It is wrapped in a local ""Harness"" that gives the ""Brain"" (LLM) a ""Body"" (Shell, Filesystem, Memory) to act in the real world. 3. 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 > 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀: Instead of 100 brittle ""Jira Plugins,"" the agent uses primitive tools (Bash, Grep, Edit) to compose any workflow a human engineer can execute. 4. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝘆: The 200k context window is a scarce resource. The architecture protects it with auto-compaction, sub-agents, and semantic search to prevent ""Context Collapse."" 5. 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗨𝗻𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝗹 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀: Runaway loops, amnesia, and permission roulette are not bugs—they are structural constraints. This design turns them into managed features. 6. 𝗖𝗼-𝗘𝘃𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The harness is designed to shrink. As models get smarter, hard-coded scaffolding (like planning steps) is deleted, making the architecture thinner over time. This isn't just about coding tools—it's the blueprint for any agentic system.

ariadi,"This first article of 2026 offers a brief reflection on the technology outlook shaping the year ahead. As we moved closer to 2026, technology trend reports converged on familiar themes: AI everywhere, agentic systems, platform consolidation, rising cyber risks, and increasing pressure to demonstrate real value from technology investments. However, what is less discussed and more interesting is why many organisations, including those across Indonesia and Asia-Pacific, will still struggle despite seeing these trends well in advance. What the 2026 Trend Reports Are Saying AI as Foundation : AI is no longer a differentiator, it is becoming foundational infrastructure that every enterprise must master. Agentic Systems : AI agents and automation will move closer to core operations, transforming how work gets done. Escalating Cyber Risks : Cybersecurity risks are escalating alongside autonomy, requiring new governance models. Cost Accountability : Shareholders are demanding clearer ROI from technology spend, i.e. experimentation must prove value. Across industries, especially finance and telecommunications in Indonesia and the region, these messages keep repeating. On the surface, this sounds like progress. In reality, it signals a fundamental shift from experimentation to accountability. The era of ""AI because we should"" is ending. The era of ""AI because it measurably changes outcomes"" is beginning. The Real Constraint Is Not Technology What stands out to me the most is this: The biggest risks in 2026 are not technological, but they are structural. Most organisations already have access to powerful AI platforms, mature cloud services, advanced security tooling, and experienced vendors. Yet many still struggle to scale, control cost, or explain value. Why? Because operating models, architectures, and governance mechanisms have not evolved at the same pace as the technology itself. For Indonesian enterprises, this challenge is compounded by rapid digital transformation timelines and diverse regulatory environments. AI, Cost, and the End of ""Invisible Spend"" One recurring theme across 2026 outlook is cost discipline, particularly around AI and cloud. This is not surprising. AI workloads expose inefficiencies quickly: Duplicated data pipelines Parallel platforms solving similar problems Experimental environments that quietly become permanent Scaling costs that outpace business impact It's not surprising to see that in many organisations AI spend is still fragmented across innovation budgets, IT projects, and business units. That fragmentation makes cost both hard to see and hard to challenge. The result is not runaway spending, but unexplained spending, which is often more dangerous. This year will likely be the year when CxOs are forced to jointly answer a harder question: Which AI capabilities are we intentionally building, and which ones are just accumulating? Security and Autonomy: A Defining Tension Another trend gaining attention is the rise of autonomous and agent-based systems, paired with growing concern from security leaders. This tension is real. Autonomy promises: Faster decision-making Reduced operational effort Scalable intelligence But it also introduces: New insider threat models Reduced transparency Harder-to-audit decision paths Many organisations are enthusiastic about deploying AI agents, but far less prepared to govern them. In regulated industries, this gap will surface quickly not as a future risk, but as an operational one. Governance will increasingly determine how far autonomy can go, not ambition. What This Means Practically Overall, the 2026 technology trends point to a shift in expectations for all of us: From solution delivery to system stewardship : Taking responsibility for the long-term health and evolution of enterprise technology ecosystems. From innovation velocity to sustainable value creation : Building capabilities that deliver measurable, lasting business outcomes. From technology adoption to architectural and financial accountability . This is less about choosing the right tools, and more about: Designing Platforms for Scale. Build architectures that are intended to grow sustainably, not just work for today's use case. Embedding Governance Upfront. Integrate governance where technology decisions are made, not as an afterthought or audit exercise. Making Costs Visible Early. Ensure spending patterns are transparent before they become political issues in the boardroom. We might need to say no more often, design more intentionally, and align technology decisions tightly with enterprise outcomes. Closing Thought The technology outlook for 2026 are not surprising. What is surprising is how consistently they point back to the same underlying challenge: we are running tomorrow’s technology on yesterday’s structures. AI, autonomy, and advanced platforms will continue to evolve rapidly. Whether organisations benefit from them, or struggle with cost, risk, and complexity, will depend far less on the tools they choose, and far more on the foundations they have already put in place. A question for all of us . Which will be harder in 2026: adopting new technology or unlearning old ways of running it?",5.0,0.0,37,,1225,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],5215,5213,764,764,48,3,0,0,"this first article of 2026 offers a brief reflection on the technology outlook shaping the year ahead. as we moved closer to 2026, technology trend reports converged on familiar themes: ai everywhere, agentic systems, platform consolidation, rising cyber risks, and increasing pressure to demonstrate real value from technology investments. however, what is less discussed and more interesting is why many organisations, including those across indonesia and asia-pacific, will still struggle despite seeing these trends well in advance. what the 2026 trend reports are saying ai as foundation : ai is no longer a differentiator, it is becoming foundational infrastructure that every enterprise must master. agentic systems : ai agents and automation will move closer to core operations, transforming how work gets done. escalating cyber risks : cybersecurity risks are escalating alongside autonomy, requiring new governance models. cost accountability : shareholders are demanding clearer roi from technology spend, i.e. experimentation must prove value. across industries, especially finance and telecommunications in indonesia and the region, these messages keep repeating. on the surface, this sounds like progress. in reality, it signals a fundamental shift from experimentation to accountability. the era of ""ai because we should"" is ending. the era of ""ai because it measurably changes outcomes"" is beginning. the real constraint is not technology what stands out to me the most is this: the biggest risks in 2026 are not technological, but they are structural. most organisations already have access to powerful ai platforms, mature cloud services, advanced security tooling, and experienced vendors. yet many still struggle to scale, control cost, or explain value. why?

security and autonomy: a defining tension another trend gaining attention is the rise of autonomous and agent-based systems, paired with growing concern from security leaders. this tension is real. autonomy promises: faster decision-making reduced operational effort scalable intelligence but it also introduces: new insider threat models reduced transparency harder-to-audit decision paths many organisations are enthusiastic about deploying ai agents, but far less prepared to govern them. in regulated industries, this gap will surface quickly not as a future risk, but as an operational one. governance will increasingly determine how far autonomy can go, not ambition. what this means practically overall, the 2026 technology trends point to a shift in expectations for all of us: from solution delivery to system stewardship : taking responsibility for the long-term health and evolution of enterprise technology ecosystems. from innovation velocity to sustainable value creation : building capabilities that deliver measurable, lasting business outcomes. from technology adoption to architectural and financial accountability . this is less about choosing the right tools, and more about: designing platforms for scale. build architectures that are intended to grow sustainably, not just work for today's use case. embedding governance upfront. integrate governance where technology decisions are made, not as an afterthought or audit exercise. making costs visible early. ensure spending patterns are transparent before they become political issues in the boardroom. we might need to say no more often, design more intentionally, and align technology decisions tightly with enterprise outcomes. closing thought the technology outlook for 2026 are not surprising. what is surprising is how consistently they point back to the same underlying challenge: we are running tomorrows technology on yesterdays structures. ai, autonomy, and advanced platforms will continue to evolve rapidly. whether organisations benefit from them, or struggle with cost, risk, and complexity, will depend far less on the tools they choose, and far more on the foundations they have already put in place. a question for all of us . which will be harder in 2026: adopting new technology or unlearning old ways of running it?",-15,too_long,this first article of 2026 offers a brief reflection on the technology outlook shaping the year ahead,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,2,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,65,65

srijit-mukherjee,"Our understanding of the world begins with our five senses. We see, hear, feel, smell, and taste. These senses provide raw data. This data is unstructured and chaotic. The brain does not simply record this data. It actively works to understand it. It builds an internal model of the world. This model is a representation of reality. It is the brain's best guess about what exists outside. These internal representations are not the world itself. They are a simplified version. For example, your brain does not store every dog you see. Instead, it builds a concept of ""dog."" This concept is your brain's model for that category of animal. Building the Model: A Step-by-Step Process The brain builds this model through a step-by-step process. This is called hierarchical processing. First, the brain detects simple features. In vision, it finds edges, spots of light, and basic colors. In hearing, it processes simple tones and frequencies. These are the basic building blocks. The brain then combines these simple features. Edges become shapes. Shapes become objects. Tones become phonemes. This happens in higher-level brain areas. An abstract concept, like ""dog,"" is the highest level. It is a composition of many features. It combines visual shapes, sounds like barking, the feeling of fur, and contextual clues like a leash. This abstract model is ""invariant."" This means you can recognize a dog from different angles and in different breeds. Learning Without a Teacher: Prediction and Error (similar to self-supervised learning) We learn these models without a teacher. This is called unsupervised learning. The brain's main tool for this is prediction. The brain is a prediction machine. It constantly guesses what will happen next. For example, seeing a furry, four-legged shape in a park triggers the ""dog"" model. The brain then predicts a tail and a bark. These predictions are compared to reality. The difference is called ""prediction error."" This error is a crucial learning signal. If the prediction is correct, the model is reinforced. If it is wrong, the model is updated. This is a self-supervised loop. The world itself provides the feedback. Another key mechanism is Hebbian learning. The rule is simple: ""cells that fire together, wire together."" When neurons are active at the same time, their connection strengthens. Repeated experiences build strong neural pathways. This turns fleeting patterns into stable concepts. The Emergence of Language Language emerges from this system. Words are symbols for our internal representations. The word ""dog"" is a label. It points to the complex, multi-sensory model in your brain. We use these symbols to communicate. Language allows us to transfer our internal models to other people. We can share our understanding of the world. Language also structures our private thoughts. We can use words to reason, plan, and reflect. A thought popping into your head, like ""apple,"" is not random. It is your brain's predictive machinery connecting learned patterns. Our experience of reality is a constructed model. The brain builds this model from sensory data. It uses a hierarchical process, from simple features to abstract concepts. It learns by predicting and correcting its errors. Language is the symbolic tool we use to express and share this model. This entire system—senses, hierarchical modeling, prediction, and language—explains the flow of human cognition. We are not simply reacting to the world. We are constantly generating predictions about it. We are building and refining our internal model. We use language to share and structure this model. This is how we navigate reality. This is the foundation of human experience. This process—senses, model-building, prediction, and language—is the foundation of human thought and communication.

damiencummings,"Singapore just made AI mandatory. PM Lawrence Wong will personally chair the National AI Council. Five senior ministers sit on it. S$1B in R&D. Four national AI missions across manufacturing, logistics, finance, and healthcare. The PM is staking political capital on this, and that should tell you everything about where Singapore is heading. But here's what concerns me. After 30 years leading digital transformations and teaching AI strategy to Fortune 500 companies and Singapore government agencies, the pattern is predictable: companies will take the 400% tax deduction, bolt AI onto broken processes, call it transformation, and move on. Workers will get 6 months of free premium tools, learn the basics, then go back to organisations that haven't changed a thing. PM Wong said it himself: ""end-to-end transformation is demanding"" and ""even major global companies are grappling with this."" This is a stark warning. The real risk is that organisations will adopt AI superficially. They will run pilots, build chatbots, claim progress, all while their actual processes, roles, and decision-making stay exactly the same. I call this the Hollow Organisation problem. The metrics look green but their capability is gone. Budget 2026 gives you the incentives. The Champions of AI programme. The expanded PSG. The tax breaks. The upskilling pathways. None of it matters if leadership doesn't fundamentally rethink how the organisation works. This is a business transformation mandate, not simply another IT project. And the gap between companies that understand that and companies that don't is about to become very visible.

This pattern continues to surface across large enterprise programs. In conversations with CFOs, Heads of Procurement, and senior finance leaders, the discussion quickly moved beyond AI hype to architecture-level questions: Is spend data truly trusted, normalized, and governed? Is AI embedded into core transactional workflows, or operating in isolation? Can the operating model sustain decision automation at scale?

yujunliang,"The Pursuit of Happyness(1) ☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁ Introduction Ever since I joined Fidelity on October 26th, 2015, my manager had been asking us to learn Amazon Web Sevices (AWS) and get the Developer certification. I was writing a book at that time so I really didn't have more time to pursue certifications. A coworker collected some study materials and I estimated it would take one year to complete all the materials. I didn't want to spend one year getting a certification. In May 2016, half-year passed and there was no sign of me taking it seriously, my manager started asking about progress more frequently during the status meetings. Finally, I completed the draft of the book and had time to prepare for certifications. The book is here, Selenium WebDriver: From Foundations To Framework . On May 13th, I asked Tieyi Guo whether he had taken AWS Certifications, and he told me that he had gotten AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate after one month of preparation. It was so inspiring to see people near you achieve something so I thank Tieyi for inspiring me to pursue the AWS Certifications! I started the AWS certification journey on May 14th, 2016. [Note0] AWS Certified Developer - Associate Following Tieyi's advice, I purchased acloud.guru course developed by Ryan Kroonenburg from udemy.com and started watching it in my spare time. I was pretty busy with my day job since I was a DevOps architect. Not only do need I to construct pipelines for multiple functional teams at the same time but also need to answer people's inquiries about the pipelines and sometimes support calls from the teams. So the only available time was nights and weekends. I do one hour in the morning, two hours at night every day during workdays, and 4 hours every day on weekends. The udemy course was not long, only 8 hours and I completed it in one week. Since I had strong development background in J2EE and all those services required by the Developer exam are similar to some J2EE services so it is not difficult for me to understand them by applying the concepts I learned from J2EE. I watched it one more time the second week and felt confident about it so I took the practice exam from AWS. I passed! Then I scheduled the real exam for Developer - Associate on Saturday, May 28, 2016. And not surprisingly, I passed! AWS Certified Solution Architect - Associate Through the study from udemy, I found out the course is actually developed by A Cloud Guru, so I transferred my purchase from udemy to A Cloud Guru. From there I found out that many people were taking the certifications and every day there was at least 60 people got certified in Solution Architect alone. I was inspired by those people and I made the decision to continue the journey to get all of them. It is easy to make a decision but it is difficult to carry it through. However, from that day on, I managed to pump all my spare time into AWS study. The course alone would not help you to pass the exam, the instructors also ask people to read FAQs and white papers. I bought a Kindle so I can read AWS FAQ anytime I got a couple of minutes. But the diagrams are not displayed properly so I bought an iPad later to read white papers. The diagrams are much better on an iPad. It only took me two weeks to get the first certification so I was overconfident I took this exam on June 4th, 2016, and failed at 61%. My heart sank after I saw the result but I didn't give up, I continued studying and reading more whitepapers. Finally, I passed Solution Architect - Associate exam on Saturday, June 25th, 2016. AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate After I failed Solution Architect - Associate exam, I started preparing for SysOps Administrator - Associate since I need to wait for two weeks before another attempt. I did the practice exam on AWS and passed, so I took the real exam but unfortunately, I failed at 65% on June 13th, 2016. I could have passed if I managed to learn a little more. I didn't give up and continued learning. I passed SysOps Administrator - Associate exam on July 1, 2016. It was a Friday before the holiday so I could leave earlier for the exam since the exam center was closed on Saturday for the long weekend. AWS Certified Solution Architect - Professional I used Acloud.guru courses alone for all three associate-level exams! After passing 3 associate exams, I became more confident that I could achieve the professional level. I was excited about that. People said the Professional level exams are extremely hard so besides using Acloud.guru, I also started using linuxacademy.com for the preparation of professional-level exams. I found their practice exam pretty good. It took me almost two months to get ready for the professional level and I passed Solution Architect - Professional on August 27th, 2016 on my first attempt. The exam is no doubt one of the most difficult ones since it requires a lot of reading and thinking during a 3 hours period and it can test people's time management skills as well since you need to keep a constant pace and keep focused at all times. AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional After another three weeks of study, I passed the DevOps Engineer - Professional exam on September 17, 2016, on my first attempt. When I prepared, the course from linuxadademy.com wasn't ready and the only course available was from acloud.guru. The exam is very deep in certain areas and I read user guides on CloudFormation, OpsWorks, and Elastic Beanstalk. Preparation From May 14th to September 17th, I spent all my weekends studying AWS materials. Every workday, I got up at 6 AM and while feeding my dog, I watched Acloud Guru videos so I didn't waste time. The fraction of time added up to one hour in the morning. And I allocated at least two hours every night to study as well. On weekends, I went to a local coffee shop and studied there for at least 4 hours every day. Don't want to repeat the contents, but these blog posts gave me some insights on how to prepare for professional-level exams. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-road-success-oliver http://cantrill.io/certification/aws/2015/10/04/passing-the-aws-solutions-architect-professional-exam.html https://hydrasit.com/passed-aws-solutions-architect-professional-exam/ I highly recommend reading them if you are planning to take professional-level exams. Motivation(Fictional) If you ever wonder how did I have so much motivation to complete all of them in so short a time, here is the story. I had a dream. In the dream, Confucius said, AWS is a humongous beast, if you only pass AWS Certified Developer, you can only know AWS as a snake. You need to pass the other ones to know it as a tree, a wall, a fan and a rope. What animal is it? Gandhi said, an elephant. [Note1] I woke up and made the decision to pursue them all. Confucius said, Happyness comes from moving out of your comfort zone, conquering your fear and achieving your goal. It is important to have a goal and pursue it. If you are not sure about yourself, go watch this movie, The Pursuit of Happyness [Note2] and you can also understand why the title of this article was spelled wrong. Now I graduated from AWS Academy and I am helping team members to get certified. Certification shows some level of competency and it is also an indication that you are willing to learn new things and are capable of acquiring them. I did it. The key is determination and dedication. With the same amount of determination and dedication, you can do it too. I will be happy to see more and more people get certified. [Note3] More Certifications AWS released more certifications and I completed all 9 AWS Certifications on 2/24/2018! Total Recert! When the first 5 certifications expired, I did a total recert. With the help of whizlabs.com , this certification became easier to crack. https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6461159282338525185 AWS Certified Alexa Skill Builder - Specialty AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty AWS Certified Database - Specialty https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yujunliang_aws-certified-database-specialty-activity-6643214944915509248-pVEU AWS Certified Data Analytics – Specialty AWS Certified Solution Architect - Professional The Story of This Journey Exam History This is the entire history of AWS exams, hope it is helpful for you to know the effort required to get fully certified!

This AI era makes that mission more critical than ever. 🚀 At our second Google for #Singapore event, we announced 10 (!!) new initiatives across 4 pillars that mark the next chapter of our partnership with the nation… initiatives that will ensure Singapore continues to remain at the forefront of the global AI-powered economy. This is all underpinned by a significant expansion of Google's R&D footprint. We were honoured to have our SVP and CFO, Anat A. share this news and talk about how we’re growing specialised teams across software engineering, UX design, and research science to build local capabilities that don't just serve the region, but export homegrown innovation to the world. ✨ But technology alone isn't the goal. Success means weaving AI into the very fabric of the nation, across four key pillars: 🏥 Solving society’s challenges: We’re partnering with AI Singapore to build the nation’s first foundational health AI model that reflects Singapore's unique healthcare context using our MedGemma model. And we are collaborating with healthtech startup AMILI on a precision nutrition programme to provide personalised lifestyle and nutrition guidance. 👨🏼💻 Empowering the workforce: We want to get AI into the hands of every Singaporean. We introduced ‘Majulah AI’, our renewed commitment to fuel Singapore’s next wave of growth, by providing tailored AI training for every segment of the population…. job seekers, entrepreneurs, seniors and more. And we’re excited to be launching new initiatives for our students, educators and working professionals. 🏢 Driving innovation for growth: For deeper collaborations with companies, we have launched the Google Cloud Singapore Engineering Centre to significantly grow our team of software engineers and front line support teams to partner with companies and drive the future of AI innovation. 🛡️ Creating a secure ecosystem: Security is the bedrock of trust. We’ve announced an AI Centre of Excellence for Security to stay ahead of frontier risks like agentic AI. For our younger users, we’ve begun rolling out new age assurance solutions to ensure safer, age-appropriate digital experiences. The ""Singapore Spirit"" is defined by government, industry, and community moving in lockstep. Together, we’re empowering Singaporeans today, for tomorrow—from Singapore to the world. A huge thank you to Minister Josephine Teo and US Ambassador to Singapore. Dr. Anjani Sinha, for gracing our event. And of course, to all our partners for making this vision a reality!

rakeshgohel01,"2026 will be dominated by Multi-AI Agent systems and workflows So, if you want to lead, start here... Single-agent systems handle tasks linearly, simple, but limited. Multi-agent systems distribute work across specialized agents, enabling parallel execution, faster processing, and smarter collaboration. 📌 Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent: difference? Single-agent systems - Single-agent systems are centralized—one agent handles everything sequentially. - Simple to build, but slower for complex tasks with higher inference time. Multi-agent systems - Multi-agent systems are distributed—specialized agents work in parallel. - More complex to develop, but faster through specialization with lower inference time and collaborative reasoning. The key difference? Single agents execute tasks one by one. Multi-agents collaborate intelligently in parallel. 📌 Here are 6 proven multi-agent design patterns you need to know: 1\ Sequential Pattern - Agents work in a chain, each refining the output before passing it forward. - Perfect for data processing pipelines and automated Q&A verification workflows. 2\ Parallel Pattern - A divisor agent splits tasks across multiple specialists, then aggregates results. - Ideal for real-time information retrieval and financial risk analysis. 3\ Hierarchical Pattern - A meta-agent delegates to specialized sub-agents based on query requirements. - Great for complex decision-making and service orchestration. 4\ Generator and Critic Pattern - Generator agents create outputs while critic agents evaluate quality in an iterative loop. - Best for code generation and automated design workflows. 5\ Human-in-the-Loop Pattern - Combines AI automation with human approval for critical transactions. - Essential for billing systems, compliance workflows, and high-stakes decisions. 6\ Composite Pattern - Merges multiple patterns—generators create, critics review, all coordinated by a meta-agent. - Perfect for end-to-end automated workflows requiring both creation and validation. 📌 Try out these patterns with Google ADK from here: https://lnkd.in/gSnX4dsd 📌 If you want to understand AI agent concepts deeper, my free newsletter breaks down everything you need to know: https://lnkd.in/g5-QgaX4 Save 💾 ➞ React 👍 ➞ Share ♻️ & follow for everything related to AI Agents",230.0,38.0,1,,144174,post,0,2,1,"['https://lnkd.in/gSnX4dsd', 'https://lnkd.in/g5-QgaX4']",0,[],10,6,"['📌', '📌', '📌', '📌', '💾', '➞', '👍', '➞', '♻', '️']",0,[],2299,2227,324,314,24,2,0,0,"2026 will be dominated by multi-ai agent systems and workflows so, if you want to lead, start here... single-agent systems handle tasks linearly, simple, but limited. multi-agent systems distribute work across specialized agents, enabling parallel execution, faster processing, and smarter collaboration. single-agent vs multi-agent: difference? single-agent systems - single-agent systems are centralizedone agent handles everything sequentially. - simple to build, but slower for complex tasks with higher inference time. multi-agent systems - multi-agent systems are distributedspecialized agents work in parallel. - more complex to develop, but faster through specialization with lower inference time and collaborative reasoning. the key difference? single agents execute tasks one by one. multi-agents collaborate intelligently in parallel. here are 6 proven multi-agent design patterns you need to know: 1 sequential pattern - agents work in a chain, each refining the output before passing it forward. - perfect for data processing pipelines and automated qa verification workflows. 2 parallel pattern - a divisor agent splits tasks across multiple specialists, then aggregates results. - ideal for real-time information retrieval and financial risk analysis. 3 hierarchical pattern - a meta-agent delegates to specialized sub-agents based on query requirements. - great for complex decision-making and service orchestration. 4 generator and critic pattern - generator agents create outputs while critic agents evaluate quality in an iterative loop. - best for code generation and automated design workflows. 5 human-in-the-loop pattern - combines ai automation with human approval for critical transactions. - essential for billing systems, compliance workflows, and high-stakes decisions. 6 composite pattern - merges multiple patternsgenerators create, critics review, all coordinated by a meta-agent. - perfect for end-to-end automated workflows requiring both creation and validation. try out these patterns with google adk from here: url if you want to understand ai agent concepts deeper, my free newsletter breaks down everything you need to know: url save react share  follow for everything related to ai agents",-15,too_long,"2026 will be dominated by multi-ai agent systems and workflows so, if you want to lead, start here",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,9,0,0,0,0,0,-18,2,-7,1,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,19

srijit-mukherjee,"In the last 6 months, I have been using AI (ChatGPT) and related tools live to enhance the students' active learning experience. Here is my realization of the sequence of experiments. I have talked in depth about my approach/ philosophy to teaching in this article: The ONLY way to TEACH - Insights from a DECADE of my teaching career & more. The prominent theme that I converged on is the idea that {"" Learning = Teaching "" and "" Active Learning ""}. In other words, if I truly understand how I learn, I and make my learning systems better, and I will be able to simulate that learning experience in my teaching methodology. To use AI for learning and teaching, we have to understand how great teaching was achieved before AI. Let's say I am teaching mathematics, data science, statistics, deep learning, machine learning, etc., to my students (or anything fundamental). First of all, the goal of teaching is not to tell the students what I know. It's to make them think like I am thinking, step by step. Now, if I don't know how I am thinking step by step, I will never be able to teach them. To make the students think, one has to engage them in discussions, activities, and problem-solving. More than that, I train the students on ""how to think"", ""on how to ask questions"", ""what fundamental questions to ask"", and then finally ""how to use AI to answer those questions step by step"". This step-by-step thinking style is not possible without a mentor in person - this is not possible with just a video and a problem set to solve. Previously, asking these questions and finding answers was hard and unstructured. We have to ask on Google or go to a library, except that it could be in one chapter, and then look into the chapter if the question is there. Then, finally, get the answer from combinations of multiple books. This had its advantage of learning more actively, while picking up other concepts on the fly, which helps in the long run. A teacher's role is the following. Knowledge is stored not as individual elements of memory but as a knowledge graph (dense) with concepts and understanding as shown below. While the students may hear and learn about something online, the connections and the depth of understanding are lacking. A teacher's role is to close that gap with appropriate activities, questions, problem-solving, and projects that develop the connections one by one. Also, a proper assignment/testing system should be the same, which tests the connections more. Now with AI, this process can be faster. Step 1: Understand and document how you think. This step will turn out to be a sequence of questions (simple problems) that I have learnt how to solve over them. Write down those questions step by step. Let’s design a sequence of simple questions to build your understanding of conditional probability from the ground up. What changes when I know something has already happened? How does new information reduce the possible outcomes I should consider? Does knowing a partial outcome make all remaining possibilities equally likely? What does it mean to condition on an event? How do I update my sample space after observing a partial event? Is the conditional probability the same as the original probability? Why or why not? How does conditioning affect independence between events? Step 2: Transform these questions into solvable problems / projects. These solvable problems/projects/questions act as active learning materials. But a good quality step 1 is necessary. That quality step 1 varies from teacher to teacher, depending on one's knowledge. Q1. If I tell you that a card drawn is red, what’s the probability it’s a heart (Builds conditional filtering: Sample space has already been reduced.) Q2. Suppose 3 coins are flipped. I tell you at least one is heads. What’s the probability all are heads? (Creates tension between raw intuition vs filtered outcomes.) Q3. You roll a die. What's the probability it's greater than 4 given that it's even? (Forces understanding of ""restricting"" to a new sample space.) Q4. You draw one card from a deck. What is the probability that it’s a queen given that it’s a face card? (Explicit enumeration of reduced sample space.) Q5. There are 5 red balls and 3 green balls in a bag. One is drawn, and it's red. What’s the chance the next one is red? (Highlights independence and false conditioning.) Step 3: Understand where the students get stuck, simplify. & solve . Now, as a student gets stuck on a problem/project, it means that the student's specific neurological connection is not developed in the knowledge space. So, the teacher has to make efforts to simplify, go back to the basics, solve problems, build the connection, and go back to the advanced problem. Also, one should understand that these connections are not always instantaneous. These connections take time to develop over time. Accordingly, the teacher has to manage the pace and the course structure. Bonus Step 4 : Understand the Audience & Time and Teach If one wants a crash course in a topic, you have to understand that the knowledge space the students don't want the full knowledge space; rather, the students want a subgraph of it while merging the nodes. For example, let's say a concept A <-> concept B <-> concept C. The students want a direct connection between concept A and concept C without knowing about concept B. Concept A: Definition of Conditional Probability -> Concept B: Understanding Joint Probability (P(A ∩ B)) -> Concept C: Bayes’ Theorem and Its Applications Now, doing this needs a fundamental understanding of one's knowledge graph, and where to remove the edge, and where not to remove the edge of understanding. This is the place where AI can help you accelerate your journey of creating problems/ assignments/ projects, while the teacher will guide you in the exact concepts, questions, and broader ideas. Concept A: What is P(A | B)? → Explain joint probability briefly with a few examples. → (skip in depth understanding of joint probability) → Concept C: Apply Bayes’ Theorem to diagnose diseases Bonus Step 5 : This is what I do to teach in Live Class Step 1 : I understand the audience & time. Step 2: I understand where I have to start and finish. Step 3: I use my understanding (knowledge graph) to build step-by-step concepts. Step 4 : I subdivide my step-by-step concepts into further concepts & questions. Step 5 : Each question has an idea or concept attached to it sequentially. Step 6 : Ask mini-questions to test the intermediate understanding of students. Step 7 : Show the students how to find answers to these mini questions using ChatGPT. Step 8 : Give small but deep assignment problems for the students to think about. Step 9 : (for advanced students) Solve a bigger project with the students, where you guide in the intermediate steps, and act as an advisor. That's what professors do with PhD students. Having the fundamental threads of ideas and concepts connected in your head and transforming that detailed threadlist into sequential problem-solving, activities, and projects, which the students can solve and get motivated, is the foundation of great teaching. This is the fundamental idea behind active learning. I hope it helps the teachers and students to learn and teach. Also, to discover the real soldiers, who stick out in a group, you have to give hard questions that require more generalization and time to think.

For pre-seed founders, that can make a real difference. The problem is simple: most founders don’t know which family offices actually invest at pre-seed, who inside them makes decisions, or how to reach them. So we built something to fix that. We’re sharing a curated list of 144 family offices that are actively deploying capital at the earliest stages. but the list is only a part of the resource You also get a complete outreach playbook built from real, recent raises. The playbook includes • Email templates that get responses, tested by 100+ founders • How to find warm intros through LinkedIn, even with no shared connections • What to say on the first call , and what to avoid • Follow-up sequences that convert without sounding desperate • What to do when they pass, and how to stay warm for future checks • Clear timeline expectations, so you don’t waste weeks guessing Click below to access the resource: want more resources?

vishesh-gandhi,"💡 AI Agents vs Agentic AI vs LLM vs RAG 🤖 Agents An agent is a single autonomous component that: • Perceives input • Applies rules or a model • Takes actions toward a goal Think of an agent as one worker doing a specific task. Example: A bot that monitors a server and automatically restarts it when CPU crosses a threshold. 🧠 Agentic AI Agentic AI is a system-level approach where: • Multiple agents work together • Tasks are decomposed and orchestrated • The system can reason, plan, act, and adapt • Goals are achieved with minimal human supervision Think of Agentic AI as an organization—roles, workflows, decision-making, and feedback loops. Example: An incident-response system where: • One agent detects an outage • Another analyzes logs • A third rolls back a deployment • A fourth notifies Slack All coordinated automatically. 🤖 LLM (Large Language Model) An LLM is a foundation model trained on massive text data to: • Understand language • Generate text • Answer questions • Reason over learned patterns Example: Email drafting, generic chatbots, FAQ assistants. 📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) RAG is an architecture/framework, not a model. It enhances an LLM by: • Retrieving relevant data from external sources (docs, DBs, APIs, vector stores) • Injecting that data into the prompt • Generating grounded, up-to-date responses.

rachpradhan,"Hey guys, I built a package manager that installs software 10 to 500x faster than Homebrew and 2.8x faster than apt-get on Linux. It's called nanobrew. A 1.2 MB static binary written in Zig. No runtime dependencies. No Ruby. Works on both macOS and Linux. Just install it from https://lnkd.in/g3v4UXR2 Here are the numbers on macOS (Apple Silicon, CI verified): ffmpeg (11 dependencies): Homebrew: 19.6 seconds nanobrew: 2.1 seconds cold, 0.56 seconds warm tree (0 dependencies): Homebrew: 5.5 seconds nanobrew: 0.68 seconds cold, 10 milliseconds warm And on Linux (Docker, ubuntu:24.04): curl (32 dependencies): apt-get: 34.1 seconds nanobrew: 12.2 seconds (2.8x faster) curl + wget + git (60+ dependencies): apt-get: 49.7 seconds nanobrew: 25.0 seconds (2.0x faster) So how is it this fast? A few things compound together. On macOS, it uses native HTTP instead of spawning curl subprocesses, streaming SHA256 verification so it checks the hash while downloading instead of after, native Mach-O binary parsing instead of shelling out to otool, and APFS clonefile for zero-copy materialization from a content-addressable store. Everything runs in parallel: dependency resolution, downloads, and extraction all happen at the same time. On Linux, it does native ar archive parsing without needing dpkg, native zstd and gzip decompression without external binaries, BFS dependency resolution with topological sort for .deb packages, and parallel downloads with streaming SHA256 verification. The cache is content-addressable so warm installs skip the download entirely. It also handles ELF binary relocation with RPATH and interpreter fixups. The output is byte-identical to dpkg-deb extraction. In Docker you can replace apt-get entirely: COPY --from=nanobrew/nb /nb /usr/local/bin/nb RUN nb init && nb install --deb curl wget git Speed wasn't the only goal though. I wanted it to actually replace both Homebrew and apt-get. So it supports the same Homebrew bottles, formulas, and cask definitions on macOS. Native .deb packages from Ubuntu repos on Linux. Third-party taps where you can run nb install user/tap/formula and it parses the Ruby formula directly from GitHub, no brew tap step needed. Source builds for formulas without pre-built bottles. And all the lifecycle stuff: upgrade, rollback, pin/unpin, doctor, cleanup, bundle export/import, launchctl services on macOS, systemd services on Linux. The tap support is something no other fast Homebrew client has. It fetches the Ruby formula from GitHub, parses it line by line, resolves dependencies, and installs. About 2 seconds total. The whole thing compiles to a 1.2 MB static binary. For reference, Homebrew's Ruby runtime is 57 MB.

yujunliang,"The Pursuit of Happyness(2) ☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁ Fidelity Investments is a great financial services company and their campus in Westlake is only 3 miles away from my home. I started working there since 2015 and had a very successful 2016. Many people had seen me getting many certifications, but people worked closely with me also knew that I designed the framework for fast mass pipeline construction for DevOps and wrote a book on internal Ribbit site to explain the design philosophy and principles and coached numerous developers to build pipelines by themselves rather than relying on a centralized DevOps team(If you work for Fidelity, you can search my name to find all the articles I wrote on Ribbit). since I wanted to be an enabler, not a pure doer to maintain a stable job. Together, we, the DevOps enablement team and the development teams built more than 100 pipelines using the framework and the same practice was replicated across multiple business units within the organization. We are the hidden figures behind those pipelines. I was also an unofficial leader in AWS Certification movement, inspired hundreds of people to learn this fantastic technology and was nominated as Master Mentor for AWS Certification Study on Fidelity's Westlake Campus. Before I left, I had shared my study approach with the people and helped people preparing for the industry strength certification. People respect me as a servant leader and an inspirational figure in the organization. I thank my managers in Fidelity for giving me the opportunity to work on those challenging tasks and also constantly challenged me to excel! But I voluntarily discontinued my employment with this great company. Why would I have left such a successful position from such a great company on such a negligible commute? The reason is: If I continued to work for Fidelity, my impact would be limited to the business unit, or maybe some other business units inside this company. But I hope to have a greater impact on the industry. The only channel where I can find such leverage is through a consulting company. That way, I will be able to apply my knowledge and leadership to the clients of my employer and be a multiplier. Thus I decided to leave the uncomfort zone and moved back to consulting, which means not only working, but also traveling away from my family. But it is part of job and I can live with it. And thank my family for being supportive. I also thank my future colleagues for accepting me as their peer. And thank my past managers for being my references one more time. Due to my foreign education background, past contracting engagements and my immigration status, the background check and H1-B transfer process were very lengthy and complex. I applied this position on October 2nd and got the offer on December 9th but I can only start working on Feb 20th. So I thank the recruiting team and onboarding team of Deloitte Consulting, background investigation team from First Advantage and immigration team from Guberman Garson LLP . Thank all of you for the effort you put into this hiring process. I also want to thank my future managers and colleagues for being patient. It is not possible to make this happen without the support from each one of you. Finally, I can start this exciting new journey! We are ambitious. We are bonded. We are consultants. We are Deloitte.

srijit-mukherjee,"Understanding the full pipeline of a machine learning project is crucial for efficient model development and deployment. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the AI training, validation, and testing process using PyTorch, illustrated through a clean and practical diagram. 1. Data Organization Data Directory + CSV : All input data (images, volumes, etc.) are stored in a folder structure. A companion CSV file logs the paths to the data and the corresponding labels for each sample (x1, x2, y, etc.). 2. Dataset Class Construction PyTorch Dataset : The core of any ML pipeline in PyTorch. init : Load the CSV paths and initialize transformations or configs. len : Define dataset size. getitem : Load and return tensors from paths with transformations applied. You may apply custom logic, preprocessing, or data augmentation inside. 3. Transformations and Augmentations Data Augmentation : Introduced through PyTorch transforms. Applied within getitem . Useful during training for regularization and improving generalization. 4. Data Representation Tensor Outputs: Each sample returned has shape (C, H, W). No batch dimension is added at this stage - that’s handled by the DataLoader. 5. Batching with DataLoader DataLoader : Wraps the Dataset to produce batches. Automatically adds batch dimension: final shape becomes (B, C, H, W). Handles shuffling, multi-threaded loading, and batch collation. 6. Separate DataLoaders Training, Validation, Testing Loaders: Split the dataset by index or patient ID. Each loader produces batched tensors for the specific phase. 7. Training Loop (Neural Network Solver) Training Phase: Loop through batches for each epoch. For each batch: Forward pass through model Compute loss Backpropagate gradients Update weights via optimizer Loop continues over all epochs. Validation Phase : Similar batch-wise forward pass (no gradient updates). Used to monitor model generalization and tune hyperparameters. 8. Model Saving Save Checkpoint: Trained model is saved in .pth format. Enables deployment or further fine-tuning. 9. Testing and Evaluation Testing Phase: Identical to validation phase in structure. Final metrics computed to evaluate model performance after training.

srijit-mukherjee,"Not very long back, I spent 13 hours debugging a training loop that looked correct. I asked AI to help me out to write the code. AI (all of them) wrote perfect solutions that ran well! I am working on a medical image segmentation problem where I needed to train on 2D slices on a 2D neural network but also wanted to enforce 3D consistency across the volume. The plan is: Phase 1: Train a U-Net on individual 2D slices Phase 2: Take those predictions, stack them into 3D volumes, and apply a 3D loss function Write a demo dataloader, use MONAI's 2D UNet, and a Solver class in Pytorch to train the Neural Network. The loss was decreasing, the code ran without errors. When I tested the model, it performed pretty well. So, what's my complain about? What's the issue? It wasn't actually updating my model. What I Was Trying To Do I was working on a medical image segmentation problem where I needed to train on 2D slices (for efficiency) on a 2D neural network but also wanted to enforce 3D consistency across the volume. The plan was: Phase 1: Train a U-Net on individual 2D slices Phase 2: Take those predictions, stack them into 3D volumes, and apply a 3D loss function This makes sense, right? Train on slices, then check if the full volume looks good. I asked AI to write this code. The Bug: My Code Looked Fine But Wasn't Working Here's what my training loop looked like: # Phase 1: Train on 2D slices for images, masks, patient_ids in train_loader: outputs = model(images) loss_2d = dice_loss(outputs, masks) loss_2d.backward() optimizer.step() # Store predictions for later use in Phase 2 predictions[patient_id] = outputs.detach().cpu() # Phase 2: Build 3D volumes and apply 3D loss for patient_id in predictions: volume_3d = stack_slices(predictions[patient_id]) loss_3d = compute_3d_loss(volume_3d, ground_truth_3d) loss_3d.backward() optimizer.step() Do you see the problem? I didn't, for way too long. The problem was, I read the overall code, without going into the nitty gritty. Turns out, I had broken the gradient flow without realizing it. I'm sharing this because it's the kind of bug that doesn't throw an error—it just silently fails. The issue is that .detach() call in Phase 1. When you detach a tensor in PyTorch, you cut it off from the computation graph. So when I computed loss_3d in Phase 2, it had no connection back to my model parameters. The gradients from Phase 2 were being computed, but they had nowhere to go. It's like writing an email and never hitting send—you did the work, but nothing happened. Why This Bug Is Sneaky This is what made it so hard to find: No error messages - PyTorch didn't complain because technically everything was valid Loss was decreasing - Phase 1 was working fine, so my loss curves looked normal The code ran fast - No memory issues, no crashes, just wrong results Common pattern - Using .detach() to save memory is standard practice I only caught it when I added explicit gradient checks: loss_3d.backward() # Check if gradients actually exist total_grad = sum(p.grad.abs().sum().item() for p in model.parameters() if p.grad is not None) if total_grad == 0: print(""WARNING: No gradients!"") # This fired That's when I realized Phase 2 wasn't actually updating my model. The Fix: Re-run The Forward Pass The solution is not to store the predictions at all. Instead, store just the information needed to regenerate them: # Phase 1: Train on 2D slices normally for images, masks, patient_ids in train_loader: optimizer.zero_grad() outputs = model(images) loss_2d = dice_loss(outputs, masks) loss_2d.backward() optimizer.step() # Store which slices belong to which patient patient_slices[patient_id].append(slice_index) # Phase 2: Re-run forward passes to rebuild the graph for patient_id in patient_slices: optimizer.zero_grad() predictions = [] for slice_idx in patient_slices[patient_id]: image = load_slice(patient_id, slice_idx) output = model(image) # New forward pass = new gradients predictions.append(output) volume_3d = torch.stack(predictions) loss_3d = compute_3d_loss(volume_3d, ground_truth) loss_3d.backward() # Now gradients flow back to the model optimizer.step() By re-running the forward pass in Phase 2, you create a fresh computation graph that connects the 3D loss to your model parameters. Yes, it's more computation. But that's the price of having gradients flow correctly. But, there was another problem that I didn't show in the code. For the 3D loss, I cannot use all the patients together. It is equivalent to use all the patient slices in 2D in a single go. Then, it is equivalent to use the entire dataset right? Then, what is the use of batches. I did something similar to batching in 3D but patient wise ofcourse for I did each patient-wise updates within each epoch. Later I tested that 3 patients work well. This worked excellently well with some computational cost. But AI couldn't just do it! It failed and failed, every single time. It was so robust to not change the way I wanted it to be. It always detached. I realized that proper memory optimization is important and clever engineering (by AI) can break training. So, I have to do the thought experiment myself of the memory optimization process (step-by-step) beforehand. Should I not use AI? This is a pretty hard question. After all these happened I asked AI a better prompt. I have 50 patients each with number of slices 70 and their segmentation masks. I want to do the following. I want to train a 2d segmentation model in a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method. At the end of every epoch I want to apply 3d segmentation loss too, and optimize it. Of course this will cause memory overload because while calculating the 3d loss back-propagation it is a lot of computation and gradients because it is for all the slices (not in batches). However for the 3d loss part I want to do similarly to a batching but with respect to one or two patients. How to implement this in pytorch. I want to make sure that the 3d loss based backpropagation actually updates the gradients of the 2d model. The model predictions shouldn't get detached or moved to cpu. Then, it gave me the correct code to train the model. I am just wondering, if I could've just thought for an hour and used documentation to write the entire code + use the AI autocomplete in another hour. This is not something boiler plate - not something you find every now and then on internet data - hence AI fails terribly. AI is good for what usually exists on the internet. But, as Andrej Karpathy said, a random internet data is terrible. Do watch his recent podcast with Dwarkesh Patel. AI can produce ""okay - good"" results based on the training. Still, it will not solve based on the newest knowledge or documentation that came out, and it is too biased on the memory of the old data, like autoregressive models. So, to understand the new documentation/paper of a new approach (which is really huge in cardinality), one needs to understand the code/concept -> Then select the top few (20% -> which gives 80% results), -> and then use RAG for better results. But to train oneself in this, one needs to go through rigorous training (concepts + how to think). However, I do agree that product managers or others who are in more of a managerial role can transform ideas into ""proof of concepts"" faster, and hence faster experiments and decision-making.

i didn't, for way too long. the problem was, i read the overall code, without going into the nitty gritty. turns out, i had broken the gradient flow without realizing it. i'm sharing this because it's the kind of bug that doesn't throw an errorit just silently fails. the issue is that .detach call in phase 1. when you detach a tensor in pytorch, you cut it off from the computation graph. so when i computed loss3d in phase 2, it had no connection back to my model parameters. the gradients from phase 2 were being computed, but they had nowhere to go. it's like writing an email and never hitting sendyou did the work, but nothing happened. why this bug is sneaky this is what made it so hard to find: no error messages - pytorch didn't complain because technically everything was valid loss was decreasing - phase 1 was working fine, so my loss curves looked normal the code ran fast - no memory issues, no crashes, just wrong results common pattern - using .detach to save memory is standard practice i only caught it when i added explicit gradient checks: loss3d.backward # check if gradients actually exist totalgrad  sump.grad.abs.sum.item for p in model.parameters if p.grad is not none if totalgrad  0: print""warning: no gradients!"" # this fired that's when i realized phase 2 wasn't actually updating my model. the fix: re-run the forward pass the solution is not to store the predictions at all. instead, store just the information needed to regenerate them: # phase 1: train on 2d slices normally for images, masks, patientids in trainloader: optimizer.zerograd outputs  modelimages loss2d  dicelossoutputs, masks loss2d.backward optimizer.step # store which slices belong to which patient patientslicespatientid.appendsliceindex # phase 2: re-run forward passes to rebuild the graph for patientid in patientslices: optimizer.zerograd predictions   for sliceidx in patientslicespatientid: image  loadslicepatientid, sliceidx output  modelimage # new forward pass  new gradients predictions.appendoutput volume3d  torch.stackpredictions loss3d  compute3dlossvolume3d, groundtruth loss3d.backward # now gradients flow back to the model optimizer.step by re-running the forward pass in phase 2, you create a fresh computation graph that connects the 3d loss to your model parameters. yes, it's more computation. but that's the price of having gradients flow correctly. but, there was another problem that i didn't show in the code. for the 3d loss, i cannot use all the patients together. it is equivalent to use all the patient slices in 2d in a single go. then, it is equivalent to use the entire dataset right? then, what is the use of batches. i did something similar to batching in 3d but patient wise ofcourse for i did each patient-wise updates within each epoch. later i tested that 3 patients work well. this worked excellently well with some computational cost. but ai couldn't just do it! it failed and failed, every single time. it was so robust to not change the way i wanted it to be. it always detached. i realized that proper memory optimization is important and clever engineering by ai can break training. so, i have to do the thought experiment myself of the memory optimization process step-by-step beforehand. should i not use ai? this is a pretty hard question. after all these happened i asked ai a better prompt. i have 50 patients each with number of slices 70 and their segmentation masks. i want to do the following. i want to train a 2d segmentation model in a mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method. at the end of every epoch i want to apply 3d segmentation loss too, and optimize it. of course this will cause memory overload because while calculating the 3d loss back-propagation it is a lot of computation and gradients because it is for all the slices not in batches. however for the 3d loss part i want to do similarly to a batching but with respect to one or two patients. how to implement this in pytorch. i want to make sure that the 3d loss based backpropagation actually updates the gradients of the 2d model. the model predictions shouldn't get detached or moved to cpu. then, it gave me the correct code to train the model. i am just wondering, if i could've just thought for an hour and used documentation to write the entire code  use the ai autocomplete in another hour. this is not something boiler plate - not something you find every now and then on internet data - hence ai fails terribly. ai is good for what usually exists on the internet. but, as andrej karpathy said, a random internet data is terrible. do watch his recent podcast with dwarkesh patel. ai can produce ""okay - good"" results based on the training. still, it will not solve based on the newest knowledge or documentation that came out, and it is too biased on the memory of the old data, like autoregressive models. so, to understand the new documentationpaper of a new approach which is really huge in cardinality, one needs to understand the codeconcept - then select the top few 20 - which gives 80 results, - and then use rag for better results. but to train oneself in this, one needs to go through rigorous training concepts  how to think. however, i do agree that product managers or others who are in more of a managerial role can transform ideas into ""proof of concepts"" faster, and hence faster experiments and decision-making. back",-15,too_long,"not very long back, i spent 13 hours debugging a training loop that looked correct",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,5,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,3,some,-4,1,0,0,0,0,0,66,66

mrdaioff,"[ OpenClaw + Clay + GitHub + Trigger.dev + cto.new ] Six months ago, I hit a wall. I had the ideas and the expertise, but my creative workflow was broken. Like many founders, I knew I needed to be consistent on LinkedIn, but client work always took priority. The problem with outsourcing niche expertise is that no one else has your specific voice, knowledge, or insights. I didn't need a ghostwriter; I needed a Content Operating System. I started looking for ways to use AI to ""know"" me better. I dug past the surface of basic prompting and discovered RAG, but not enough for the complexity I wanted. So I went deeper into GraphRAG. The breakthrough came through my network: - Saw a post from Max doing exactly what I was trying, in n8n . - Shared that with Tobias , who showed me how he was implementing similar systems. - My biz partner Brad (ultimate AI nerd and best-selling author on RAG) helped me define the boundaries of the possible. - Brainstormed tech stacks with Evykynn and Rebecca . - Then had a chat with Michelle where she shared her process for Git Knowledge Graphs, and the vision finally clicked. Here is how it currently works behind the scenes: I didn't want a black box, so I split the workflow: Trigger.dev handles the deterministic logic, while OpenClaw handles the agentic reasoning. And 3rd party access is managed through cto.new - Trigger.dev pulls files (transcripts, code, notes) from various sources into an intake folder. - A GitHub Action triggers and creates an issue for each new file. - OpenClaw (running as an always-live agent) ingests the content using a specific ""ingestion skill"" living in the repo. - A workflow runs checks, auto-merges the PR, and closes the issue. - The content is moved to an archive folder, keeping the workspace clean. The result is a PKB that acts as the ""smartest version of me"" in my niche. (Plus, Jacob ’s KB template helped me refine the nomenclature and keep it pro-grade). Endless nights of iteration later, and here are the 3 Biggest Shifts, well above just content: - I can add info I wish I knew but don’t have time to learn deeply yet. If I need to “know” a new thing, I auto-send Subject Matter Expert content to a folder, it gets ingested, and now I know it. lol! - I can create avatars with brains, and feed streams of knowledge in any industry to have them solve problems. - Clay MCP: connecting workbook logic to my knowledge and client context in real-time. (POWERFUL). Richard , Robert , and Dominykas are already way ahead on this -- watch this space. I think we’re transitioning from Static Skills to Dynamic Skills. - Static skills depend on fixed prompts and stale information. - Dynamic skills keep learning. They take in new information all the time and adjust how they think and work in real time. So we can build expert AI avatars that don’t just follow instructions.

Can your model resist malware requests when the intent is hidden across seemingly harmless steps? 🧠 Key idea: Most safety evals test single-turn malicious prompts. But real attacks are more challenging. For example, an attacker can decompose malicious tasks into benign-looking subtasks across multiple turns. ◽️ We define a novel code decomposition attack, where malicious intent is obscured by breaking a harmful task into a series of seemingly benign subtasks across multiple conversational turns ◽️ We curate a benchmark and dataset consisting of diverse multi-turn strategies across 13 malicious categories ⚠️Main findings ◽️Both open-source and closed-source code LLMs fail badly under multi-turn attacks. ◽️Rejection rates drop dramatically when malicious intent is spread across turns, even for strong models. Fine-tuning on MOCHA (e.g., via LoRA) ✅ substantially improves robustness ✅ preserves coding ability ✅ generalizes to other adversarial benchmarks!

ariadi,"In this edition, we turn our attention to a challenge that's quietly impacting many organizations: Architectural Debt as a Strategic Risk. Understanding Architectural Debt: More Than Just a Technical Issue Think of architectural debt like financial debt. Short-term decisions such as quick fixes, rushed integrations, or deferred refactoring allow teams to deliver faster today, but they accrue ""interest"" in the form of higher maintenance costs, reduced agility, and increased risk over time. If managed intentionally, this debt can even serve as a lever for growth. Left unchecked, however, it becomes a heavy burden that slows innovation and inflates expenses. In 2011, the technical debt metaphor, originally coined by Ward Cunningham in 1992, was still gaining traction beyond developer circles. Together with colleagues from the Software Improvement Group (SIG) Joost Visser and Tobias Kuipers , building on data from real-world systems monitored by SIG, we managed to make technical debt more tangible for IT executives: translating vague notions of ""technical debt"" into financial terms like principal and interest, complete with a case study showing potential ROI from quality investments. We argued that technical debt isn't just a code-level issue—it's a strategic one, especially as systems scale. Evolution Over 14 Years Fast-forward to late 2025, and technical debt has evolved dramatically: Architectural technical debt now dominates discussions, often comprising 20-40% of an organization's technology landscape. Governance frameworks, tools like static analysis and debt trackers, and practices such as intentional refactoring allocations (e.g., 10-20% of sprint capacity) have become standard in mature organizations. The explosion of cloud modernization, microservices, and AI has amplified the ""interest payments"". Brittle legacy integrations and fragmented designs now manifest as higher cloud costs, slower innovation, and heightened security risks. What started as a metaphor for developers has become a boardroom topic, with concepts like FinOps and zero-trust embedding debt management into enterprise strategy. Enduring Core Idea The core idea from our 2011 technical debt framework holds up strongly: quantify the debt , measure the interest, and treat it as an investment decision. Organizations that do this proactively, i.e., through cross-functional governance and regular assessments, can turn potential liabilities into manageable assets. I'm glad that this early empirical foundation contributed to the growing body of knowledge on managing technical debt. If anything, the need for such frameworks is even greater today in the hyper-scale, AI-driven world. Recent insights highlight the scale of the problem: On average, around 40% of infrastructure systems carry significant technical debt concerns, often rooted in architectural compromises (Gartner, 2025). CIO surveys indicate that technical debt can represent 20-40% of an organization's entire technology landscape (McKinsey). By 2026, Gartner predicts that 80% of technical debt will be architectural in nature, making it the dominant form as enterprises scale cloud and AI workloads. This isn't just a developer concern anymore—it's a strategic business risk. Architectural debt hampers cloud modernization efforts, drives up operational costs in multi-cloud environments, and limits an organization's ability to respond to disruption. The Cloud Modernization Challenge: Where Debt Compounds As companies accelerate cloud adoption for resilience, cost optimization, and AI readiness, architectural debt often worsens. Legacy integrations create complexity, shadow IT emerges in hybrid setups, and inconsistent designs lead to higher cloud spend without proportional value. Common pain points I've seen include: Brittle architectures that make migrations expensive and risky. Fragmented governance leading to over-privileged access. Deferred refactoring that blocks the shift to cloud-native benefits like scalability and faster innovation. Without addressing these, modernization projects risk failing to deliver ROI—turning what should be a growth enabler into a costly overhaul. How Strong Governance Helps ""Pay Down"" Debt Intentionally Fortunately, there is good news. Effective IT governance turns architectural debt from a liability into a manageable asset. By embedding oversight into strategy, we can prioritize repayment while continuing to innovate. Here are practical steps to get started: Quantify and Visualize the Debt : Conduct an architecture assessment to map debt hotspots. Tools for static analysis and observability can reveal complexity, dependencies, and risk scores. Establish Cross-Functional Governance : Form a governance board with IT, architecture, security, and business stakeholders. Align debt reduction with business outcomes, e.g., allocate 10-20% of engineering capacity to intentional refactoring. Integrate Debt Management into Cloud Strategy : During modernization, embed principles like FinOps for cost control, zero-trust security, and modular design. Adopt frameworks such as COBIT or NIST to guide decisions. Prioritize Strategically : Focus on high-interest debt first, i.e., areas impacting scalability, security, or AI integration. Treat it like portfolio management: pay down what blocks growth. Measure Progress : Track metrics like velocity improvement, cost savings, and risk reduction. Organizations that prioritize governance-led debt reduction often see faster service delivery and better alignment with business goals. Your Thoughts?

srijit-mukherjee,"I once spent hours coding a neural network with zero intuition for how it actually worked. The cycle was brutal: 1️⃣ Code → 2️⃣ Error → 3️⃣ Paste to AI → 4️⃣ Debug → 5️⃣ Repeat. After 15 iterations , I wanted to scream. Every error screamed one truth: ❗ ""MATH IS NOT OPTIONAL."" Every failure is traced back to: Linear algebra shape errors ([H,W,C] vs [C,H,W]) Loss function mismatches (BCELoss vs raw logits) Autograd traps (missing zero_grad() or in-place ops) [See my Top 18 NN Vibe Coding Traps👇] Mismatched layer I/O dimensions Missing view() before linear layers Sigmoid + BCELoss (use BCEWithLogits!) Forgetting train()/eval() mode Device mismatch (CPU vs GPU tensors) ... [ Full list in original post ] Recently, I undertook the task of cleaning up an AI-related codebase—using AI itself. The approach was structured and methodical: 1. Pseudocode Conversion : First, I translated the existing code into pseudocode to abstract away implementation details while preserving logical structure. 2. AI-Assisted Implementation : The pseudocode was fed into an AI model to generate an optimized implementation. 3. Iterative Refinement : The pseudocode was edited for clarity, and the AI-generated code was reviewed and adjusted. (In my own experience) Pseudocode has proven to be an effective high-level representation for AI-assisted coding, serving as an intermediary that bridges human intent and machine execution. For students, this is important because writing pseudocode is an important skill to note. Despite initial success, two subtle bugs emerged, consuming significant debugging time: Bug 1: Batch Size Mismatch - Original Code : batch_size = 32 (fixed size) - AI-Generated Code : batch_size = images.size() (dynamic size) - Impact : Inconsistent training behavior due to varying batch sizes, leading to unstable loss curves. Bug 2: Early Stopping Failure - The AI implemented a mechanism to save the ""best"" model weights during training. - However, the final model did not match the best checkpoint. - Root Cause : Missing a deep copy of weights, leading to unintended reference updates. Debugging Methodology - Unit Testing : Added validation checks for batch processing and weight storage. - Checkpoint Evaluation : Manually compared model performance across saved checkpoints. - Loss Analysis : Verified expected vs. actual loss trajectories to detect anomalies. Key Takeaways: AI as an Assistant, Not a Replacement 1. AI Generates Runnable Code, Not Always Correct Logic - While AI can produce syntactically valid code, logical coherence is not guaranteed. - Domain expertise remains essential for ensuring correctness. 2. Prompt Engineering Helps, But Testing is Critical - Well-structured prompts improve output quality, but rigorous validation is non-negotiable. - Unit tests, integration checks, and manual reviews are indispensable. 3. Strong Fundamentals Multiply Productivity - For engineers with solid coding skills, AI accelerates development by automating boilerplate and suggesting optimizations. - Those without debugging experience struggle when AI-generated code fails silently. 🌀 ""You vibe code when you don’t need to vibe code."" AI accelerates work ONLY when you understand fundamentals. When I later used AI to refactor a codebase via pseudocode → AI implementation, subtle bugs still crept in: Dynamic vs Fixed Batch Sizes : images.size() broke training stability Early Stopping Sabotage : Missing deepcopy() corrupted ""best"" weights AI gave runnable code—but I had to catch flawed logic through: ✔️ Unit tests for tensor dimensions ✔️ Manual checkpoint validation ✔️ Loss curve forensics The Future: AI Logic Units (AILU) and Modular Problem-Solving AI’s role in software development mirrors the evolution of computing: - Historical Parallel : Early computers were built using logic gates, leading to Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs). - Emerging Paradigm : AI systems must be decomposed into fundamental problem-solving units—AI Logic Units (AILUs). - Agentic AI : Breaking complex tasks into smaller, AI-solvable components. As AI continues to evolve, the most effective engineers will be those who: - Understand how to decompose problems effectively. - Leverage AI for automation while maintaining rigorous oversight. - Combine prompt engineering with systematic testing. AI is a powerful collaborator, but it does not replace the need for skilled engineers. Debugging, logic validation, and system design remain firmly in the human domain—for now. The Core Principle: Atomic Decomposition ""If an AI can’t solve a problem, dissect it until it can."" This mirrors computing’s evolution: Why does this change everything ? AILUs are fundamental problem-solving blocks (e.g., ""validate tensor dimensions,"" ""optimize loss pairing""). Like LEGO bricks, they’re reusable, testable, and composable. Human engineers become system architects , not just prompters. Building with AILUs: A 4-Step Framework (Inspired by Anthropic’s Agentic AI & Cursor’s architecture) Decompose Ruthlessly Assign Micro-AI Agents Embed Evaluation Systems Orchestrate with Human Oversight Engineers design the workflow: The Engineer’s New Mindset ""The best AI architects think like circuit designers."" Master these skills: Problem Fracturing : AILU Cataloging : Validation-First Design : The Future is MORE Modular As Anthropic notes , Agentic AI isn’t just automation—it’s redefining problem-solving itself .

""you vibe code when you dont need to vibe code."" ai accelerates work only when you understand fundamentals. when i later used ai to refactor a codebase via pseudocode  ai implementation, subtle bugs still crept in: dynamic vs fixed batch sizes : images.size broke training stability early stopping sabotage : missing deepcopy corrupted ""best"" weights ai gave runnable codebut i had to catch flawed logic through: unit tests for tensor dimensions manual checkpoint validation loss curve forensics the future: ai logic units ailu and modular problem-solving ais role in software development mirrors the evolution of computing: - historical parallel : early computers were built using logic gates, leading to arithmetic logic units alus. - emerging paradigm : ai systems must be decomposed into fundamental problem-solving unitsai logic units ailus. - agentic ai : breaking complex tasks into smaller, ai-solvable components. as ai continues to evolve, the most effective engineers will be those who: - understand how to decompose problems effectively. - leverage ai for automation while maintaining rigorous oversight. - combine prompt engineering with systematic testing. ai is a powerful collaborator, but it does not replace the need for skilled engineers. debugging, logic validation, and system design remain firmly in the human domainfor now. the core principle: atomic decomposition ""if an ai cant solve a problem, dissect it until it can."" this mirrors computings evolution: why does this change everything ? ailus are fundamental problem-solving blocks e.g., ""validate tensor dimensions,"" ""optimize loss pairing"". like lego bricks, theyre reusable, testable, and composable. human engineers become system architects , not just prompters. building with ailus: a 4-step framework inspired by anthropics agentic ai  cursors architecture decompose ruthlessly assign micro-ai agents embed evaluation systems orchestrate with human oversight engineers design the workflow: the engineers new mindset ""the best ai architects think like circuit designers."" master these skills: problem fracturing : ailu cataloging : validation-first design : the future is more modular as anthropic notes , agentic ai isnt just automationits redefining problem-solving itself . early adopters are already: designing ailu marketplaces sellbuy specialized units. creating ""ai compilers"" that auto-assemble ailus for tasks. replacing legacy codebases with ailu grids see cursors demo .",-15,too_long,i once spent hours coding a neural network with zero intuition for how it actually worked,no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,27,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,1,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,69,69

srijit-mukherjee,"Automating the DINO Game - Update 2.0. While performing the second update to the DINO game automation, I realised that if I change the scale of the screen play, then it fails. I have already predefined templates of the image at a certain scale, so in the very initial few frames, the goal is to detect the scale at which the detection works the best. Also, in the last video, I said that it is hard to detect objects, because they are of random shape. So, I tried to keep the threshold low, this results in a few false positives (which anywhere are quite far away), but since there is a single obstacle image, it can detect a single obstacle among some convoluted obstacles, because each obstacle is concatenation & flips & shifted versions of a single cactus / obstacle image. This information also will help us in building an obstacle detection CNN, where we will keep the data augmentation in that manner. Also, for any machine learning learning, instead of letting the model fully detect features, I want the model to learn the algorithm based on certain predefined features like location of the dino, and the obstacles you can see on the screen, because that’s exactly how I am discovering the pattern to play. This will help us use any ML algorithm to find out the best location of the DINO wrt the other obstacles to jump. This a look ahead method, because if there is less gap in the upcoming obstacles, then jumping a bit early is useful than jumping at a very specific pixel distance all the time. I will share the next update soon. Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions. Happy to learn and discuss with interested individuals.

srijit-mukherjee,"Sorry, I couldn't express my emotions without my mother tongue. However, one kind person Rohit Sharma has translated this into English at the end. Many thanks to him. অঙ্ক করা অনেকটা ধ্যান করার মতন। প্রথমে একটা অঙ্ক নিয়ে আমি একটা খাতায় লিখি, আজকাল অবশ্য ipadএ। তারপর আমি কিন্তু একদমই মস্তিস্ক বা মনকে জোর করিনা যে ""এই অঙ্ক এসেছে, অঙ্ক কর, নাহলে গাঁট্টা দেব""। একটু চোখ বন্ধ করে যদি ভালোবেসে মনকে বলি ""এই অঙ্ক এসেছে, করবি নাকি?"", মন আনন্দে নাচতে নাচতে বলে ""চল করি""। বেশ মনের মাঝে একটা ওই একটা কিরকম অনুভূতি হয়, আর পেটের মাঝে ওই যে ইংরেজিতে বলে ""butterflies in your stomach"" feeling। ওই ভাবের মাঝেই বেশ একটা ধ্যানের মতন পরিবেশ সৃষ্টি হয়ে - শান্ত, নির্মল, তবে একটা শক্তি আছে, একটা তাগিদ আছে ওই অঙ্কটা বোঝার, ওই অঙ্কটা solve করার challenge। এটা কিন্তু বাইরে না সবটাই চলে মনের ভেতরেই... সে বাইরে তারস্বরে বাচ্ছাই কাঁদুক, বা বাইরে bulldozerই চলুক, সব ভুলে মন সেই আনন্দে আত্মহারা, হয়তো এটাই ধ্যান - মনের আনন্দে কোনো কিছু খুঁজে পাওয়া । যাইহোক তারপরে শুরু হয়ে মস্তিষ্কের সঙ্গে গল্প। মন আসলে ওই পরিবেশটা তৈরী করে দেয়, আর মস্তিস্ক ওই বন্ধুর মতন গল্প করে। মস্তিস্ক শান্ত হয়ে বসলে ধীরে ধীরে জিজ্ঞেস করি ""আচ্ছা, এরকম কিছু অঙ্ক দেখেছো নাকি?""। মস্তিস্ক যদি উত্তর জানে, তাহলে ওই একটা ছোট্ট বাচ্ছার উৎসাহ নিয়ে বলে ""হ্যা হ্যা, ওই যে ওই দিন কে এরকম ভাবে করেছিলাম""। আমি বলি ""দাড়াও। এতো ছটফট না করে ধীরে ধীরে ভাবো।"" মস্তিস্ক কিন্তু বেশি গোলমাল করে না, ওই cute পোষা কুকুরের মতন puppy face করে শান্ত হয়ে মাটিতে বসে পরে। তারপর মস্তিস্ক কে জিজ্ঞেস করি ""আচ্ছা, ওই যে বললে যে ওই ভাবে করেছো, কেন করলে ওটা? কোনো specific কারণ আছে?""। মস্তিস্ক একটু ভাবে। আমিও time দি। মস্তিস্ক ভাবতে ভাবতে, আমি একটু মনের ওই ভাবের নদীতে ডুব দিয়ে আসি। এসে fresh হয়ে বসি। মস্তিস্ক ready থাকে। গড় গড় করে সব বলে দেয়। আমিও খাতাতে টুকে নি। আমার আর কি কাজ, সারাজীবন টুকেই টুকেই কাটালাম। আমি কিছুই করিনা, সব ওই মস্তিস্ক করে। আমি শুধু টুকি আর বলি ""বাব্বা! অঙ্ক কি কঠিন!"" এবার যদি আমার ছাত্র ছাত্রীদের পড়াতে হয়, আমাকে প্রায়শই একটু আরো গভীরে যেতে হয়। তখন আরো একটু বেশি প্রশ্ন করি মস্তিস্ককে। কোনোদিনই মস্তিস্ককে বিরক্ত হতে দেখিনি। একটু ঘুম পেলে, ঘুম দিই। আবার উঠে ভাবি। ওই ঘুমের মধ্যে কিন্তু মস্তিস্ক আবার একটু preparation নেয়, আমার অজান্তে - কি করে সেটাও কোনোদিন জানিনা, হয়তো জানবো না। কিছু কিছু জিনিস কোনোদিন হয়তো জানবো না। ক্ষতি কি? না জানাই ভালো। Doing math is a lot like meditating. First, I take a problem and write it down in a notebook — these days, of course, it's on the iPad. But I never force my brain or mind with commands like, ""This problem is here, now solve it, or else!"" Instead, I gently close my eyes and lovingly ask my mind, ""Here's a problem — would you like to try it?"" And my mind, dancing with joy, responds, ""Yes, let’s do it!"" It creates a feeling deep inside, something hard to describe — almost like that fluttering sensation in the stomach, what they call ""butterflies in your stomach"" in English. In that feeling, a meditative state emerges — calm, pure, yet filled with energy and a kind of urgency — an urge to understand the problem, a desire to take on the challenge of solving it. But all of this happens within. Even if a baby is wailing outside, or there's a bulldozer roaring past, the mind forgets everything else, lost in that joy. Perhaps this is what meditation is — the joy of discovering something in complete absorption. Then begins the conversation with the brain. The mind creates the environment, and the brain, like an old friend, begins to chat. Once the brain is calm, I gently ask, ""Have you seen a problem like this before?"" If the brain knows the answer, it replies with the enthusiasm of a little child, ""Yes, yes! Remember that time we solved it like this?"" And I say, ""Wait. Don't get too excited. Think it through slowly."" The brain doesn't make too much fuss — like a cute, obedient pet dog, it sits down quietly with puppy eyes. Then I ask, ""Alright, you said you solved it that way before — but why? Was there any specific reason?"" The brain thinks. I give it time. While the brain is thinking, I dive back into that emotional river within the mind — I come out refreshed. By then, the brain is ready. It pours everything out, clearly and quickly. I jot it all down. That’s all I do — my whole life has passed just taking notes. I don't do anything — the brain does all the work. I just scribble it down and say, ""Wow! Math is hard!"" But when I have to teach my students, I often need to go a bit deeper. Then I ask the brain even more questions. I’ve never seen it get annoyed. If it’s tired, I let it nap. When I wake up, I think again. But during that sleep, somehow the brain has done a bit of prep work — I don’t know how. Maybe I’ll never know. Some things, maybe, are best left unknown.

yujunliang,"The Pursuit of Happyness(4) ☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁☁ Introduction In January 2017, AWS released another 2 certifications after I became fully certified in 2016 [1] , AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty AWS Certified Advanced Networking - Specialty I passed AWS Certified Big Data - Specialty on July 22nd, 2017 [2] . It is a hard exam, no doubt of it, but I relied on my working experience on S3 and Redshift, as well as an excellent course from Sanjay Kotecha . I didn't feel it particularly difficult to pass. But AWS Advanced Networking is so hard. It became generally accepted that it is the hardest exam among 8 AWS certifications. Many people with CCIE also failed at the first attempt. If you don't know, CCIE is the most admired certification in the networking space. It is even harder for people not from networking backgrounds. I used to be a Java developer before 2016, who never heard of CIDR, BGP, and VLAN. Networking used to be so boring and I never imagined that I would become a Network Engineer. But ever since started working on the cloud, I always need to work on infrastructure and networking-related projects so I decided to learn networking. Also, since this is the only AWS certification I didn't have, I planned to get it at any cost. Comparing AWS Certifications I have taken all AWS certifications, so I have an idea how what each certification is like, here is my measurement of the difficulty and scope of these exams, AWS Advanced Networking is the hardest of all. Early Stage of the Preparation I took the beta exam on 01/31/2017 to get a benchmark and secure a half-price voucher, not surprisingly, I got 24% since I knew nothing about networking at that time. I started preparing for it by watching Acloud.guru course from Adrian Cantrill , normally at late night, but I normally fell sleep since I was tired. I watched this course many times but couldn't get it due to the unfamiliarity of the topics. For a long time, I didn't seem to be able to learn it, I was frustrated sometimes. I read Network+ and CCNA books, but it didn't help much either. Attempt before re:Invent I had completed both Acloud.guru and LinuxAcademy.com courses on this exam and did well in the practice exams provided by them. I decided to attempt it before re:Invent and hopefully to attend re:Invent as a fully certified AWS professional. There was a Thanksgiving break before the re:Invent and I had 2 days to prepare for it and I attempted it on 11/25/2017, the last available day before re:Invent. Unfortunately, it is not an easy exam that can be crammed in two days. I only got 52% on this attempt. As promised, I shaved my head for not being able to pass it. Another Attempt before New Year Deloitte gives the last week of the year as a corporate holiday, and I decided to use it to prepare for this exam and clear it before the new year. I took the exam in November, so I had an idea of what kind of questions are asked. As mentioned by many people who passed the exam, Adrian's blog can be used as the study guide, the scope of the exam is pretty much outlined in that post. So I reviewed all articles and attempted it on 12/27/2017. After time was up and the exam was submitted automatically, the hourglass on the screen spun crazily. I kept repeating it in my mind, ""Let me pass"", Let me pass"", ""Let me pass""... After the longest minute of waiting, the screen refreshed with the following message, Unfortunately you didn't pass on this attempt. This time I got 56%, slightly better than the last attempt. Disappointed, my heart sank. But I quickly accepted it and drew a conclusion I need to improve the way I study. It is uncomfortable to talk about failed exams, my friends also warned me that people will judge me. But if I didn't give you a full picture, it is not possible to let you know how difficult it is and you may also underestimate it. I told some of my friends that this is a very hard exam, but they still underestimated it and failed. So in order to pass this exam on your first attempt, the following contents are very important. Taking Expert Advice I finally realized this is a no-joke exam. There is no shortcut, I went back to square one. In September 2017, Jady Liu passed the exam and put a posting on LinkedIn, After the failed attempt on 12/27/2017, I decided to put more effort into the preparation. I read her article again and followed this advice. I noted down all important knowledge while watching acloudguru videos, which highly focused on the exam. These videos are worth watching as many as times till you fully understand all the concepts and knowledge mentioned. This advice is crucial to passing the exam, so I will give some examples in this article on how I distilled study notes from tons of information, so you can follow along. Preparing and Distilling Study Notes I searched many AWS articles and collected 140 slides of study notes, since there are so many topics covered in this exam, there are lots of content to be memorized. A study note to distill the important points from the rest of the contents is critical to passing the exam. I am giving two screenshots of the PowerPoint presentation, which can give you a direction to prepare the study notes. Illustration of the Study Notes When I felt ready to pass the exam, it became 140 slides. And this is the only exam I prepared study notes like this, for all others, I just watched videos and read materials. But I knew I wouldn't be able to pass it if I hadn't had prepared these 140 slides with distilled essence. Note: the table of contents is not a complete list, it is just the part I want myself to pay more attention to. How to Distill Verbose Contents into Concise Study Notes Just to give you another example: I read this article, The article is too long to remember, so I copied the important parts from the article and pasted them to a couple of slides, the following screenshot illustrates how I organized the articles into PowerPoint slides, the thumbnail images on the left illustrates those contents related to the network connectivity, By doing this over a 20 day period, I was able to extract the information and settle on a 140 slides PowerPoint file, I still read the original articles and watched Acloud.guru course but I planned to review this file before the exam. Please don't ask me to share this file since I may violate NDA for doing it. I just thought to share the approach to help you to be prepared. The Extraordinary Effort Besides reading all the related user guides, I also watched re:Invent videos on Networking and took notes on those important concepts. It is not easy. I spent 2 days on Thanksgiving, 10 days on Christmas and New Year break, and 3 days of the entire Martin Luther King long weekend studying it. But it is my last certification for AWS, so I made the determination to pass it at any cost! I just have this kind of persistence and dedication! I started preparing this PowerPoint file on 12/27/2017, after I prepared those slides, I finally understood networking. You can use the LinuxAcademy course as supplementary material but they are not enough to prep you for the exam. The exam relies heavily on real-life scenarios, so it is crucial to know all the topics inside out. Looking back, I should have started taking notes earlier, which is a critical technique in preparing for this exam since the scope of the exam is very broad and deep. You may not need to use PowerPoint, but you must use some method to take notes and review the notes before you go into the exam. Important Study Guides Jady mentioned you may need to watch Acloud guru many times, These videos are worth watching as many as times till you fully understand all the concepts and knowledge mentioned. I did watch many times before fully understanding the concepts of BGP and MED, also I watched re:Invent videos on Direct Connect and those videos helped me fully understand the routing, which is very important for passing the exam. I gave some examples of how to prepare the study notes and hope it is helpful for you. Also, want to let people know, it doesn't matter what background you come from, as long as you prepare with enough effort, you can pass this exam. And the knowledge you learn while preparing for the exam will help you greatly on your job. Passing the Exam On January 20th, 2018, before the exam, I reviewed the study notes of these 140 slides. When the time was up and the exam submitted automatically, I sat there blankly without hoping anything. I was afraid if I had expected I would fail again. I also knew that I had learned a lot while preparing for it and it didn't matter whether I passed it or not. When the screen refreshed, it congratulated me for passing it. And I passed the exam at 76%. It is not great but once again, I became fully certified on AWS. What's Next Just when I was about to relax and have a break, AWS released another certification, which made the journey a never-ending story. Crazy as crazy does, I became the #1 certified cloud practitioner[3] and people asked me how did I do it, it is the same way Forrest Gump ran across America. When I am tired, I sleep, when I am hungry, I eat. All my spare time, I study. Studying is exhausting sometimes, but I enjoy doing it since I made many friends along the journey, many people passed this exam before me and their success inspired me to keep running! Thank you!

data - specialty aws certified advanced networking - specialty i passed aws certified big data - specialty on july 22nd, 2017 2 . it is a hard exam, no doubt of it, but i relied on my working experience on s3 and redshift, as well as an excellent course from sanjay kotecha . i didn't feel it particularly difficult to pass. but aws advanced networking is so hard. it became generally accepted that it is the hardest exam among 8 aws certifications. many people with ccie also failed at the first attempt. if you don't know, ccie is the most admired certification in the networking space. it is even harder for people not from networking backgrounds. i used to be a java developer before 2016, who never heard of cidr, bgp, and vlan. networking used to be so boring and i never imagined that i would become a network engineer. but ever since started working on the cloud, i always need to work on infrastructure and networking-related projects so i decided to learn networking. also, since this is the only aws certification i didn't have, i planned to get it at any cost. comparing aws certifications i have taken all aws certifications, so i have an idea how what each certification is like, here is my measurement of the difficulty and scope of these exams, aws advanced networking is the hardest of all. early stage of the preparation i took the beta exam on 01312017 to get a benchmark and secure a half-price voucher, not surprisingly, i got 24 since i knew nothing about networking at that time. i started preparing for it by watching acloud.guru course from adrian cantrill , normally at late night, but i normally fell sleep since i was tired. i watched this course many times but couldn't get it due to the unfamiliarity of the topics. for a long time, i didn't seem to be able to learn it, i was frustrated sometimes. i read network and ccna books, but it didn't help much either. attempt before re:invent i had completed both acloud.guru and linuxacademy.com courses on this exam and did well in the practice exams provided by them. i decided to attempt it before re:invent and hopefully to attend re:invent as a fully certified aws professional. there was a thanksgiving break before the re:invent and i had 2 days to prepare for it and i attempted it on 11252017, the last available day before re:invent. unfortunately, it is not an easy exam that can be crammed in two days. i only got 52 on this attempt. as promised, i shaved my head for not being able to pass it. another attempt before new year deloitte gives the last week of the year as a corporate holiday, and i decided to use it to prepare for this exam and clear it before the new year. i took the exam in november, so i had an idea of what kind of questions are asked. as mentioned by many people who passed the exam, adrian's blog can be used as the study guide, the scope of the exam is pretty much outlined in that post. so i reviewed all articles and attempted it on 12272017. after time was up and the exam was submitted automatically, the hourglass on the screen spun crazily. i kept repeating it in my mind, ""let me pass"", let me pass"", ""let me pass""... after the longest minute of waiting, the screen refreshed with the following message, unfortunately you didn't pass on this attempt. this time i got 56, slightly better than the last attempt. disappointed, my heart sank. but i quickly accepted it and drew a conclusion i need to improve the way i study. it is uncomfortable to talk about failed exams, my friends also warned me that people will judge me. but if i didn't give you a full picture, it is not possible to let you know how difficult it is and you may also underestimate it. i told some of my friends that this is a very hard exam, but they still underestimated it and failed. so in order to pass this exam on your first attempt, the following contents are very important. taking expert advice i finally realized this is a no-joke exam. there is no shortcut, i went back to square one. in september 2017, jady liu passed the exam and put a posting on linkedin, after the failed attempt on 12272017, i decided to put more effort into the preparation. i read her article again and followed this advice. i noted down all important knowledge while watching acloudguru videos, which highly focused on the exam. these videos are worth watching as many as times till you fully understand all the concepts and knowledge mentioned. this advice is crucial to passing the exam, so i will give some examples in this article on how i distilled study notes from tons of information, so you can follow along. preparing and distilling study notes i searched many aws articles and collected 140 slides of study notes, since there are so many topics covered in this exam, there are lots of content to be memorized. a study note to distill the important points from the rest of the contents is critical to passing the exam. i am giving two screenshots of the powerpoint presentation, which can give you a direction to prepare the study notes. illustration of the study notes when i felt ready to pass the exam, it became 140 slides. and this is the only exam i prepared study notes like this, for all others, i just watched videos and read materials. but i knew i wouldn't be able to pass it if i hadn't had prepared these 140 slides with distilled essence. note: the table of contents is not a complete list, it is just the part i want myself to pay more attention to. how to distill verbose contents into concise study notes just to give you another example: i read this article, the article is too long to remember, so i copied the important parts from the article and pasted them to a couple of slides, the following screenshot illustrates how i organized the articles into powerpoint slides, the thumbnail images on the left illustrates those contents related to the network connectivity, by doing this over a 20 day period, i was able to extract the information and settle on a 140 slides powerpoint file, i still read the original articles and watched acloud.guru course but i planned to review this file before the exam. please don't ask me to share this file since i may violate nda for doing it. i just thought to share the approach to help you to be prepared. the extraordinary effort besides reading all the related user guides, i also watched re:invent videos on networking and took notes on those important concepts. it is not easy. i spent 2 days on thanksgiving, 10 days on christmas and new year break, and 3 days of the entire martin luther king long weekend studying it. but it is my last certification for aws, so i made the determination to pass it at any cost! i just have this kind of persistence and dedication! i started preparing this powerpoint file on 12272017, after i prepared those slides, i finally understood networking. you can use the linuxacademy course as supplementary material but they are not enough to prep you for the exam. the exam relies heavily on real-life scenarios, so it is crucial to know all the topics inside out. looking back, i should have started taking notes earlier, which is a critical technique in preparing for this exam since the scope of the exam is very broad and deep. you may not need to use powerpoint, but you must use some method to take notes and review the notes before you go into the exam. important study guides jady mentioned you may need to watch acloud guru many times, these videos are worth watching as many as times till you fully understand all the concepts and knowledge mentioned. i did watch many times before fully understanding the concepts of bgp and med, also i watched re:invent videos on direct connect and those videos helped me fully understand the routing, which is very important for passing the exam. i gave some examples of how to prepare the study notes and hope it is helpful for you. also, want to let people know, it doesn't matter what background you come from, as long as you prepare with enough effort, you can pass this exam. and the knowledge you learn while preparing for the exam will help you greatly on your job. passing the exam on january 20th, 2018, before the exam, i reviewed the study notes of these 140 slides. when the time was up and the exam submitted automatically, i sat there blankly without hoping anything. i was afraid if i had expected i would fail again. i also knew that i had learned a lot while preparing for it and it didn't matter whether i passed it or not. when the screen refreshed, it congratulated me for passing it. and i passed the exam at 76. it is not great but once again, i became fully certified on aws. what's next just when i was about to relax and have a break, aws released another certification, which made the journey a never-ending story. crazy as crazy does, i became the #1 certified cloud practitioner3 and people asked me how did i do it, it is the same way forrest gump ran across america. when i am tired, i sleep, when i am hungry, i eat. all my spare time, i study. studying is exhausting sometimes, but i enjoy doing it since i made many friends along the journey, many people passed this exam before me and their success inspired me to keep running! thank you! maybe one day, i will stop this certification run, but not now! but not now! run with me if you enjoy it! note: 1 the pursuit of happyness - my aws certification journey 2 aws certified big data - specialty 3 mad max: fury road into !  , ? 4 aws certified advanced networking official study

An AI Product Manager is not someone who simply uses AI. They are the strategic architect who bridges intelligence, systems, and business impact. Every model decision, UX flow, and prompt chain is tied to a business outcome: reduced costs, increased retention, or defensible differentiation. An elite AI PM operates at the intersection of: 1. Product Thinking → Deep empathy for users and the ability to translate pain into product opportunity. 2. Model & System Thinking → Understanding how intelligence, data, and automation interact — and how to build scalable learning loops. 3. Business Thinking → Quantifying trade-offs, managing infra costs, aligning product bets with company strategy, and driving measurable ROI. 4. Ethical & Strategic Leadership → Balancing innovation with governance, trust, and long-term defensibility. In essence: The AI PM is a part product strategist, part business operator, part AI architect.

alex-selimov,"I've been using August Bradley's ""Life Operating System"" for about 5 months now and I have to say it was a complete game-changer for me. With two kids (one under a year old), time is limited. There was only even enough to make a little daily progress on any one project. I had (and still have) a large list of projects to work on and things to learn. I needed focus to ensure that the little bit of progress I could make was on something that would yield desirable longer lasting results. August Bradley's system helped immensely with this. Planning daily activities while keeping in mind future goals really helps narrow down what things are worth doing at any given moment. The reviews have also been extremely impactful. Critically reviewing progress at the end of each week, month, and quarter gives you the opportunity to correct your heading before things go off the rails. Not sure how I got anywhere without them.

rakeshgohel01,"DMZ launched #HackTheCruve at the beginning of April to develop a solution that could alleviate some of the most significant difficulties being faced by Canadians as a consequence of COVID-19. Solutions should help business continuity, frontline worker support, healthcare improvements, supports for non-profit organizations, crisis management tools, delivery improvements, services for seniors, contact tracing and more. Town of Innisfil also participated with their five problem statements for digital communication portal, paper-based time cards, customer service chatbot, public consultations and farmer customer API. The image is from DMZ. While working on a similar social impact project called COVID19TO , our team of five was excited to build farmer customer API. Ideation After identifying the area of work, we quickly built some surveys for farmers and end-users to determine the difficulties they have been facing. We contacted more than ten farmers, more than five farmer's markets and a couple of agricultural associations and came up with this: Problem 1) On the shoppers' side, they started facing long lineups at local grocery stores. After getting into the stores, many noticed empty shelves. Additionally, they felt risky picking the produce from the stores as those produces being touched multiple individuals. Some have tried to reach delivery apps, and they found that those services are two to four weeks out for the next delivery. 2) According to StatsCan, More than 30% of household spending goes to restaurants , and we dug more. Farmers produce is directly sold to bulk-buyers like restaurants, cafeterias and other food chains. COVID-19 broke this supply chain when 60% of restaurants were closed under a government mandate to stop the further spread of this disease. The situation worsens for farmers as some of the dairy farmers were asked to dump the milk , excess mushrooms were being destroyed in northern Ontario, and chicken farmers decided to shrink national flock by 12% . Market Size 2018 report from StatsCan shows that there are $4.2 billion farms to market (farm gate + farmer's market) sales for vegetables and fruits when it combined with other poultry products reaches to $27.3 billion of total addressable market size nationally. The farmer's market constitutes $1.8 billion in sales every year in Ontario alone, and those farmer's markets were cancelled. Solution We envisioned a solution to put money back in farmers' hands. We called it. Farmer's Food Truck Working with local farmers, we gather the produce into an assembly facility and build subscription boxes with fixed items in three sizes for an individual and family of two and four. The subscription boxes are delivered by a food truck for curbside pickup weekly and bi-weekly delivery. From our research, we found that people travel a maximum of five kilometres to get their groceries. Our solution builds a community area for a similar distance. It sends a truck to schools and community centres' parking lots as these spaces are not currently used, and people showed interest in standing up to help farmers on a small rental amount. Users receive alert notifications when they can pick up their boxes in a given time-slot of 30-60 minutes. While driving through, they can maintain the social distance, and the truck driver loads boxes into a car. We also used the Shopify store to create a fast prototype to build subscription boxes. Benefits Our solution adds values for Shoppers save valuable time for not standing lines, A direct farm's to shoppers' community area delivery reduces many people touching the produce. Fresh and healthy produce for shoppers. Can give revenue back to farmers. Next Steps If we were to pursue this solution further, it would be incredibly valuable to do extensive user research, including competitive analysis, before moving forward. We worked so far from our collective knowledge and improvised research. It would be great to study the grocery shopping patterns post COVID-19 and whether shoppers would prefer a fixed type of subscription box or customized one for a given season. In conclusion, I would like to thank DMZ for generously putting this hackathon together and our mentor Shane Flynn for providing valuable inputs.

andressantana,"It was around 2003 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic while I was a senior in high school that my cousin got me into taking a Linux class taught by one of his college professors -I still remember the distro, Knoppix-. The class didn't have any structure nor any academic accreditation, it was more the get-together with a group of geeks and access to computers with Linux that made it attractive. The professor had a hands-on approach to teaching and often would say "" Linux is best learnt typing in the terminal "". That class gave me an idea of what I wanted to do in college, of course, Computer Science. To be honest, back then I didn't even know what that name meant. The college I went to didn't offer Computer Science per se, the closest they had was something I will translate as ""Computer Systems Engineering"". I enrolled and started classes in January of 2004, the same year I started working as a ""Technical Support"" for a multinational that had operations in the DR. By the way, it's very common in the DR to work while attending college (will write a post about it later). After a few months of being in the job, I was recruited to work as a Delphi programmer that included a training trip to Lexington, KY which for me was a big thing: traveling, going outside the country, getting on an airplane and bunch of other things for the first time ; I was excited. I had to stop school for a quarter but it was worthwhile. This was me debugging some spaghetti Pascal code in Delphi back in 2004 After some years of experience programming and using English frequently, many doors started to open for my professional life. I switched jobs and environment. I started programming in Java and working with Oracle DB with an awesome team of professionals working for Verizon -- all this before I had graduated from college. Before graduating I had started to look for jobs opportunities in the USA, I even signed up in several websites and uploaded my resume but I realized that without the college degree my chances were very low. So, in 2008 and less than a year to college graduation I resumed looking for opportunities outside the DR. The story goes like this: 99.99% of the companies I talked to weren't interested in sponsoring an H1B (work) visa. But you know what, I kept trying . Initially I started putting the visa requirement upfront, but then I tried the opposite; it was the last thing I mentioned, hoping that one of them will like my skills so much that they would like to at least try to sponsor me. The year was 2011 when I talked to a startup in Miami and they were interested in sponsoring me for a work visa, jackpot !!!. We did all the paperwork and by October of that year I moved with my family to Miami to work for them. It was a new life for us. We didn't have to worry anymore of not having running water or daily power outages or safety. There were a lot more opportunities there. Finally, in retrospective, I think the Miami startup was just a bridge into bigger things. After being in the startup for just 5 months I got an offer to work at Amazon and we moved to Seattle and have been here for more than 7 years now and still loving it. #TellYourStory",102.0,15.0,3469,,4258,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],1,['#TellYourStory'],3185,3180,585,585,27,0,3,0,"it was around 2003 in santo domingo, dominican republic while i was a senior in high school that my cousin got me into taking a linux class taught by one of his college professors -i still remember the distro, knoppix-. the class didn't have any structure nor any academic accreditation, it was more the get-together with a group of geeks and access to computers with linux that made it attractive. the professor had a hands-on approach to teaching and often would say "" linux is best learnt typing in the terminal "". that class gave me an idea of what i wanted to do in college, of course, computer science. to be honest, back then i didn't even know what that name meant. the college i went to didn't offer computer science per se, the closest they had was something i will translate as ""computer systems engineering"". i enrolled and started classes in january of 2004, the same year i started working as a ""technical support"" for a multinational that had operations in the dr. by the way, it's very common in the dr to work while attending college will write a post about it later. after a few months of being in the job, i was recruited to work as a delphi programmer that included a training trip to lexington, ky which for me was a big thing: traveling, going outside the country, getting on an airplane and bunch of other things for the first time ; i was excited. i had to stop school for a quarter but it was worthwhile. this was me debugging some spaghetti pascal code in delphi back in 2004 after some years of experience programming and using english frequently, many doors started to open for my professional life. i switched jobs and environment. i started programming in java and working with oracle db with an awesome team of professionals working for verizon -- all this before i had graduated from college. before graduating i had started to look for jobs opportunities in the usa, i even signed up in several websites and uploaded my resume but i realized that without the college degree my chances were very low. so, in 2008 and less than a year to college graduation i resumed looking for opportunities outside the dr. the story goes like this: 99.99 of the companies i talked to weren't interested in sponsoring an h1b work visa. but you know what, i kept trying . initially i started putting the visa requirement upfront, but then i tried the opposite; it was the last thing i mentioned, hoping that one of them will like my skills so much that they would like to at least try to sponsor me. the year was 2011 when i talked to a startup in miami and they were interested in sponsoring me for a work visa, jackpot !!!. we did all the paperwork and by october of that year i moved with my family to miami to work for them. it was a new life for us. we didn't have to worry anymore of not having running water or daily power outages or safety. there were a lot more opportunities there. finally, in retrospective, i think the miami startup was just a bridge into bigger things. after being in the startup for just 5 months i got an offer to work at amazon and we moved to seattle and have been here for more than 7 years now and still loving it. #tellyourstory",-15,too_long,"it was around 2003 in santo domingo, dominican republic while i was a senior in high school that my cousin got me into taking a linux class taught by one of his college professors -i still remember the distro, knoppix-",no_hook,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,5,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,0,none,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,75,75

At the same time, communications jamming is becoming more frequent across multiple regions of the world, degrading navigation accuracy and limiting reliance on ground based coordination.

jeremyipark,"I made a computer vision app to measure back curvature during deadlift! My previous post focused on measuring deadlift rep timing by tracking the barbell plate. Since then, I’ve added the ability to quantify back roundness, so that we can determine whether the lift was completed with either a straight back or a rounded back. This could be used to help guide proper technique during training. Here are the main technical highlights: — RF-DETR ( Roboflow ) to segment the person (great performance out-the-box with no additional training!) — YOLO11n ( Ultralytics ) for bounding box prediction around the barbell weight plate (trained on my own small dataset). — Mediapipe ( Google ) for pose landmark detection to guide the bounds for the line fitting. — Custom logic to fit a line across the back. I shared this work at AI Tinkerers Raleigh last night and got 2nd place demo! It was great to hear everyone’s feedback and to connect with this inspiring group. I’m excited for how this work can enable AI-assisted feedback and for what could be the beginning of an “AI coach.” I’m very passionate about fitness, and excited to connect with more people in this AI and fitness space. Happy to chat if you have any questions or if you just want to connect! — To explain a bit more about the plots on the right side: The Back Roundness Map shows the deviation of the estimated back curve from a line of best fit.

rubendominguezibar,"Lovable turns your deck into a web app. And it looks unfair. If you are still building decks in Google Slides, you are shipping 2014 UX in 2026. Lovable lets you write one prompt and get a full-screen, animated, web-native deck that feels like a product demo, not a PDF. It is the first time I have seen teams replace slides entirely. Some are already doing decks 100% in Lovable because the output looks cleaner, moves smoother, and is easier to share. This matters because decks are not “slides”. They are distribution.

rubendominguezibar,"AI is slipping into everything: how we write, how we hire, how we negotiate, how we build, how we raise money. The change isn't loud, but it's relentless. And the gap between people who adapt and people who don't is getting wider, faster than most realize. The Numbers Tell the Story AI adoption hit 72% across enterprises in 2024 , up from 55% in 2023. (McKinsey Global Survey) GenAI cost optimization is now the #1 priority for 67% of companies, meaning tools that were experiments last year are now budget line items. (Gartner) 40% of working hours could be augmented or automated by AI and generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs—but the timeline keeps accelerating. Entry-level hiring in ""AI-exposed jobs"" dropped 13% since late 2022. Junior positions in software development, customer service, and clerical work are disappearing faster than anyone predicted. (Stanford Digital Economy Lab) The forecast? By 2030, AI will contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy —more than the current output of China and India combined. (PwC) But here's what the numbers don't show: the quality gap. It's not just about who uses AI. It's about who uses it well. The people building systems and workflows with AI are pulling ahead at an exponential rate. Everyone else is stuck arguing whether AI is overhyped. What's Actually Happening Over the past weeks, I've been publishing a series of practical, hands-on resources focused on how builders, founders, and operators are actually using AI today. If you want to stay ahead, these are worth your time: 1️⃣ 2,500+ Angels Who Actually Write Checks for AI & SaaS A hard-to-find list of angels who are actively investing, not just talking. AI startups raised $67B in 2024—knowing who writes checks matters. 2️⃣ No One Is Safe From AI A clear look at how AI is reshaping roles across industries, not just tech. When 40% of working hours are augmentable, everyone's affected. 3️⃣ Clawdbot: The 24/7 AI Employee You Actually Own Why autonomous AI workers are replacing tools, not just assisting them.

gregoire-loeper-7252bb6,"Analytic formulas in finance: time to move on? In the 19th century, mathematics was all about finding formulas. Solving a differential equation meant writing down an explicit solution. Then something radical happened. Hadamard, Hilbert, Sobolev, and others asked a different question: instead of ""can I write down the solution?"", they asked ""does a solution exist, is it unique, and does it depend continuously on the data?"" This shift — from analytic solutions to well-posedness — was initially seen as a retreat. It turned out to be profoundly liberating. With the right abstract framework, powerful numerical methods were unlocked — finite elements, spectral methods, convex optimization — that were unthinkable in the old paradigm. It seems that quantitative finance has never really undergone this transition. We are still stuck with analytic formulas — Black-Scholes, SABR, analytic approximations for Heston — the list goes on. This is all the more striking in an era where computing power is massively and cheaply available. The original motivation for analytic formulas — avoiding costly numerical computation — has largely disappeared. Yet the formulas remain out of habit. The Black-Scholes formula, beautiful as it is, created an addiction to closed-form expressions. The entire implied volatility surface industry — SVI, SSVI, and their variants — is essentially a search for parameterizations that fit market prices while (hopefully) satisfying no-arbitrage constraints. But as Jim Gatheral and Antoine Jacquier write in their famous paper ""Arbitrage-free SVI volatility surfaces"", ""[...] indeed, efforts to find simple closed-form arbitrage-free parameterizations of the implied volatility surface are still widely considered to be futile"". The reason is structural. No arbitrage, when expressed in the right space (the space of probability measures), is a natural and even linear constraint. Expressing it in terms of implied volatility turns it into an overly complex non-linear constraint. Enforcing no arbitrage within a parametric family is like trying to solve the Navier-Stokes equations by guessing a formula. The way forward is the one mathematics discovered a century ago: stop looking for formulas. Instead, pose the calibration problem in the right space — the space of probability measures — under a well-posed convex formulation, and solve it numerically. This is exactly what optimal transport methods achieve. They produce solutions that are → Arbitrage-free by construction → Well-posed — existence and uniqueness follow from strict convexity → Numerically tractable — modern convex optimization The apparent loss — giving up the formula — is in fact the decisive gain.

yujunliang,"In 90s, China just opened the door to the world and it was in great need for CPA, so people from all background, as long as who had a 3 year college degree were encouraged to participate the qualification exam. I saw the opportunity in this field and started working on it. Unlike the certification exams in US, which people can take it whenever they feels ready, this 5 course exam only offered yearly, you need to take them at a 3 day fixed period in a classroom with other exam takers. It took me 3 years to complete all the exams. But before I passed all the exams for CPA qualification in China, I moved out of China. I still flew back to China from Singapore for the last exam and I passed. That's in 1997. 20 years has passed. With the introduction of WeChat, I connected with many old classmates and friends in China. People say I would have become a CFO of a listed company or a partner or owner of some small CPA firms if I hadn't left China. But I left China and now I am a Digital Technologist of Fidelity Investment. I advanced my career from a software engineer to a technical agile coach. I coached teams Agile Software Development methodologies such as Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Development. Normally coaches are consultants so they don't have corporate titles, but they are required to move the needles regardless. It was a rewarding experience. I also learned a lot through this experience working as a coach, since I had the chance working with a broad spectrum of people inside an organization and it also trained me towards servant leader, since I didn't have authority to order people to do things, but I could give advices and provide help if needed. Due to visa issue, I started a new job in October 2015, working in the DevOps enablement center for Fidelity Investments. I applied my knowledge learned from coaching experience to help the development teams on the DevOps transformation journey. In order to empower the team to be self sufficient, I wrote a book-like collection of document on internal wiki page as ""Patterns and Practices of DevOps Pipeline"", subtitled as ""Mass Pipeline Construction using CloudBees Jenkins""., systematically explained the process of building CI/CD Pipelines using CloudBees Jenkins Platform. Also I self-published a book with my co-author Alex Collins, Selenium WebDriver From Foundations To Framework From May to September, I also spent 4 months to study AWS extensively and acquired all of the certifications offered by Amazon Web Services and I am probably among the first 200 people worldwide who acquired all 5 AWS certifications and I am probably the one using the shortest time span. [ The Pursuit of Happyness - My AWS Certification Journey ] I also passed a Jenkins certification in October. In December, I took remaining vacation days off from work and since I didn't plan to go anywhere, I was looking for something to do. I already got 6 certifications in 2016, I decided to add another two to make it an 8. 8 is the best number in Chinese, which means Prosperous! Some people in China even pay millions to get license plates all in 8. Also I started working on Java in 1999 and got my first Java certification in 2000, that's 16 years ago! Looking back, Java had changed so much. I decided to get certified in Java 8. Once decided, I started preparing for it by reading Jeanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff's book on 12/23/2016 and I passed OCA on 12/27/2016 at 91% on a 4 day preparation. There were only 4 days left to the end of 2016, will I be ready for another exam? I wasn't so sure but I started preparing any way. By 1:00 AM on 12/30/2016, I felt confident and booked the exam. And the normal test center was fully booked, I had to book another test center far away. In this 4 day period, I did manage to read the book twice, practised all practice exam twice and reviewed the answers to understand why I failed at the first place. By 6:00PM on 12/31/2016, I passed OCP at 86%. I successfully acquired 8th certification on the last day of the year! It was so rewarding to end a year like this, I felt so young and capable. By the way, I won ""Excellence In Action"" reward in second quarter from Fidelity Investments in the sub category as ""Embrace the Future"". Probably, I am the oldest person on that category since I am already 48. I don't regret I left China and even had stayed in China, I might not have been able to become a CFO at all.

avr27,"Why it's needed? Before I tell you why it's needed, I'd like to share why I had to do it. The answer is simple: to locally test things in our ML Codebase. Now, coming to why it's needed: Amazon DocumentDB is a managed database service that is designed to be secure. This simply means that the database is hosted privately onto something called Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). In simple terms, I like to think of it as Amazon's own private internet. So DocumentDB can be directly accessed by any AWS service within the same VPC or any other having required permissions. SSH tunneling is needed when we want to access DocumentDB resources from outside the cluster's VPC, here on our local machine. To access DocumentDB from your local machine, you typically need to go through a bastion host (EC2 instance) using SSH. This extra layer of security ensures that your database connection is not directly exposed to the internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. What is SSH Tunneling? SSH tunneling, also known as "" port forwarding ,"" is a technique used to secure and encrypt communication between two computer systems over an unsecured network, such as the Internet. It involves creating a secure channel (tunnel) through which data can be transferred between a local and a remote machine. In simple terms, it's establishing a VPN. In our context: The local machine is the one running your Python script. The remote machine is an EC2 instance in your AWS environment. The SSH tunnel allows secure communication between your local machine and the EC2 instance, providing a secure pathway for data to travel. Once the tunnel is established, you can use it to connect to DocumentDB securely, as if it were running on your local machine. Code Before that, you will need a few important constants you might need. I suggest storing them as environment variables for security purposes. # SSH tunnel configuration SSH_HOST=ec2-x-x-x-x.region.compute.amazonaws.com SSH_USER=ec2-user SSH_KEY_PATH=path to ec2-host-key-pair.pem file LOCAL_BIND_PORT=3000 # any port of your choice # MongoDB server configuration MONGO_HOST=replica_db_name.*.*.docdb.amazonaws.com MONGO_PORT=27017 MONGO_USERNAME=your_monogdb_username MONGO_PASSWORD=your_monogdb_password MONGO_DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME MONGO_COLLECTION_NAME=YOUR_DEFAULT_COLLECTION_NAME # db parameters dict DB_PARAMS = { ""host"": '127.0.0.1', ""port"": LOCAL_BIND_PORT, ""username"": MONGO_USERNAME, ""password"": MONGO_PASSWORD, } SSH_HOST: is the public IP for your EC2 instance running in the same VPC as your DocumentDB. SSH_KEY_PATH: path to your key-pair.pem file. This is used to authenticate your SSH connection to the EC2 instances. NOTE: Whitelist your IP Address in your EC2 Security Groups before running the code. from pymongo import MongoClient from sshtunnel import SSHTunnelForwarder tunnel = SSHTunnelForwarder( (SSH_HOST, 22), ssh_username=SSH_USER, ssh_pkey=SSH_KEY_PATH, remote_bind_address=(MONGO_HOST, MONGO_PORT), local_bind_address=('127.0.0.1', LOCAL_BIND_PORT) ) # start the tunnel tunnel.start() # get mongo client client = MongoClient( directConnection=True, **DB_PARAMS ) # do something db = client[MONGO_DB_NAME] collection = db[MONGO_COLLECTION_NAME] documents = list(collection.find(some_query)) print(documents) # stop the tunnel and close the client client.close() tunnel.stop() client=None tunnel=None How does this work? Here is a simple picture to describe it: The figure presents a simplified overview of SSH tunneling. The secure connection over the untrusted network is established between an SSH client and an SSH server. This SSH connection is encrypted, protects confidentiality and integrity, and authenticates communicating parties. The SSH connection is used by the application ( our Python code ) to connect to the application server ( Mongo/DocDB Server ). With tunneling enabled, the application contacts a port ( = 3000 ) on the local host ( '127.0.0.1' ) that the SSH client listens on. The SSH client then forwards the application over its encrypted tunnel to the server ( EC2 Instance ). The server then connects to the actual application server ( DocumentDB ) - usually on the same machine or in the same data center as the SSH server. The application communication is thus secured without having to modify the application or end-user workflows.

ashishkhichi,"Are you building a Chain or a Brain? 🧠 Most teams moving from LangChain to LangGraph hit a wall. It’s not a syntax problem; it’s a mental model shift. In the financial sector, we’re used to deterministic workflows. Step A → Step B. But Agentic AI demands a pivot: Thinking in Cycles, not Chains. Here is the anatomy of a LangGraph workflow, decoded for the Architect: 🔹 The State (The Shared Ledger) Not just a variable, but the ""source of truth"" flowing through the graph. Every node reads it; every node updates it. It’s the persistence layer of the conversation. 🔹 Nodes (The Microservices) Isolated units of logic (LLM calls, Tool executions). Nodes are decoupled; they don't know who came before or what comes next. They only know the State. 🔹 Edges (The Intelligent Router) This is where the ""intelligence"" actually lives. Static: Direct handoffs. Conditional: The decision-making logic that determines the next hop based on the current State. 🔹 Cycles (The Feedback Loop) The ""Killer App"" of LangGraph. This allows for iterative refinement. Agent → Tool → Evaluate → Not sufficient? → Loop back. This is how we move from ""One-shot"" prompts to ""Reasoning"" agents. 🔹 Persistence (The Time Machine) State checkpoints that allow for human-in-the-loop interruptions, debugging, and ""time-travel"" to previous states.

rakeshgohel01,"The challenge of managing multiple AI agents in complex systems has long been a thorn in the side of AI development. It’s a scenario all too familiar: as projects scale, coordinating diverse AI agents becomes akin to herding particularly willful cats. Enter Swarm, a newly launched library that’s poised to revolutionize how multi-agent AI systems are orchestrated. Unveiled just yesterday by OpenAI, Swarm tackles head-on the complexities that have plagued large-scale AI projects. This isn’t about incremental improvements; it’s a fundamental rethinking of how AI agents interact and collaborate within a system. The Multi-Agent Dilemma Before diving into what Swarm offers, it’s worth revisiting the core issues it aims to solve: Coordination Overhead : As the number of specialized agents grows, so does the complexity of managing their interactions. Context Switching : Ensuring smooth transitions between agents while maintaining context has been a persistent challenge. Scalability Bottlenecks : Traditional approaches often hit performance walls when scaling to hundreds or thousands of agents. Error Propagation : In interconnected systems, errors in one agent can cascade, affecting overall system reliability. Swarm’s approach to these issues is both innovative and pragmatic, built on two core concepts: Routines and Handoffs. Routines: Teaching Your AI Agents to Dance t the core of Swarm is the idea of routines. Think of them as step-by-step plans for your AI agents. Here’s a quick example that might save you some headaches: def customer_support_routine(query): steps = [ ""Greet the customer"", ""Identify the problem category"", ""Attempt to resolve or escalate if needed"", ""Confirm resolution or next steps"", ""Close interaction politely"" ] for step in steps: response = ai_model.generate( f""Step: {step}\nQuery: {query}\nResponse:"" ) yield response # Usage for response in customer_support_routine(""My order is late""): print(response) This routine keeps your agent on track without using rigid, hard-coded decision trees. It’s flexible enough to handle surprises but structured enough to stay consistent. Handoffs: No More AI Agent Silos Here’s where Swarm really shines. Handoffs let your agents step aside when they’re out of their depth. It’s like a relay race for AIs: class SalesAgent(Agent): def handle(self, query): if ""technical"" in query.lower(): return self.handoff(TechSupportAgent()) # Handle sales query... class TechSupportAgent(Agent): def handle(self, query): if ""pricing"" in query.lower(): return self.handoff(SalesAgent()) # Handle tech support query... # Usage agent = SalesAgent() response = agent.handle(""I need technical help with my gadget"") print(response) # This will come from TechSupportAgent No more awkward “let me transfer you” moments. Your AI system moves smoothly between specialized agents. Swarm vs. The World Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Great, another framework to add to the pile.” Fair enough. Let’s break down how Swarm compares to some of the other popular tools out there: Langchain : Great for chaining LLM operations, but it can be too much for simpler agent interactions. Swarm is more focused on making agents work together smoothly. LlamaIndex : Awesome for data retrieval and indexing. If your agents need to go through a lot of data, use LlamaIndex. Swarm works well alongside it by managing the agents that use that data. Semantic Kernel : Microsoft’s offering is solid, especially if you’re deep in the Microsoft ecosystem. Swarm is more lightweight and works with different platforms. Swarm’s strength lies in its native support for multi-agent orchestration, particularly for complex, dynamic workflows. Real Talk: When to Use Swarm Swarm is best when: You’re working with multiple specialized AI agents. Your workflow needs to change dynamically (not just follow a fixed sequence). You want detailed control without dealing with a lot of extra code. Keep in mind: Swarm was just launched yesterday, and it’s not production-ready yet. It’s still early days, so there might be some bumps along the way. It’s not for you if: You need heavy-duty data processing (stick with LlamaIndex). You’re doing simple, straightforward LLM chains (Langchain might be easier). You’re fully invested in Microsoft’s AI tools (Semantic Kernel) Strategic Considerations Scalability : Swarm’s architecture could reduce operational costs for large-scale AI deployments. Development Speed : Simplifying complex agent interactions may accelerate project timelines. Adaptability : Dynamic agent composition opens up possibilities for more responsive AI systems. Quality Assurance : Built-in error handling and monitoring tools can enhance service reliability. Looking Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities Integration : How will Swarm fit into existing AI stacks? Performance at Scale : Can it handle thousands of concurrent agents efficiently? Standardization : Could Swarm’s approach become an industry standard for agent orchestration? Metrics and Debugging: How will you track agent performance and identify issues? Agent Evaluation: How will you evaluate the performance of individual agents? Compatibility with Guardrails: How will Swarm work with safety guardrails? Security and Privacy: How will Swarm handle data privacy and secure communication between agents? Maintenance Overhead: What kind of maintenance will Swarm require as it evolves? Wrapping Up: Is Swarm Worth Your Time? If you’re tired of struggling to keep your AI agents working well together, Swarm might be worth trying. It’s not perfect (nothing in AI is), but it helps make managing multi-agent systems much simpler. Try it on your next project. If it saves you from even one late-night debugging session, I’d call that a win. Happy building, and may your agents always work well together! P.S.

vinothgovindarajan,"I spent this long weekend doing something I genuinely enjoy, reading through OpenClaw’s docs and source code to understand the “magic” under the hood. 🦞 And once you strip away the hype, it’s not magic — it’s architecture. OpenClaw feels autonomous. But under the hood, it’s essentially: • A centralized Gateway control plane • Session-isolated state on disk • A lane-aware queue (1 active run per session) • An event-driven loop (time + messages + hooks + webhooks) When you see it this way, the autonomy illusion becomes understandable: Time creates an event → The Gateway routes it → The agent runs a turn → State is written → Tools execute → Result delivered. No sentience. No background “thinking.” Just inputs + state + a disciplined loop. I wrote up my learnings in Part 1 of a multi-part series, breaking down: – The control plane – Session isolation – The command queue – The runtime loop – Where “memory” actually lives – And why security is a first-class concern If you're building or evaluating agent systems, understanding these invariants matters.

srijit-mukherjee,"A third-year statistics student came to me feeling deeply stuck. Despite putting in significant effort, her grades remained low, leaving her demotivated and anxious about her future. The pressure to achieve high grades for scholarships and future opportunities felt immense and paralyzing. I saw that her situation was not unusual. The confusion grew because she performed well in subjects like inference but struggled significantly in real analysis, even with the same level of effort. It wasn’t a lack of understanding—she could grasp complex theorems and concepts—but she struggled to reproduce them during exams or prove them independently. This revealed a crucial disconnect between comprehension and exam performance. The first step I always take with students in this situation is to pinpoint where the struggle truly lies . Without understanding the root causes of past challenges, it’s impossible to direct energy toward effective improvement. In her case, she had a solid foundational understanding . The real gap was in exam-oriented preparation . She also shared her concerns about coding. Despite recognizing its importance and encouragement from her professors, she found no joy in it. She loved theoretical problem-solving, but coding felt boring and mechanical. I clarified that for her immediate goal of pursuing a good Master's degree, intense coding focus wasn’t the top priority. However, to develop an interest, I suggested she imagine something she genuinely wanted to build and then try to create it using code. I shared how I once simulated the motion of a billiard ball in R, just for fun, which made coding feel alive for me. I encouraged her to pursue personal projects (perhaps around eleven small ones), using ChatGPT and Google to overcome challenges. Success in these small, self-driven projects would naturally build confidence and make coding feel less intimidating. A significant source of her stress was the obsession with grades. I explained that grades only update every six months, and the long wait for feedback can feel discouraging. I suggested building a system that provides shorter-term approximations of progress —weekly or even daily—rather than relying solely on semester-end results. I also advised limiting social media use, especially LinkedIn, during periods of low mood, as it often worsens confidence by creating an illusion of universal success. Instead, I encouraged her to focus on consistent study and problem-solving, alternating with entrance exam preparation to maintain mental clarity. To give structure, I shared a four-step actionable framework for academic improvement : Step 1: Know your strengths. Acknowledge and appreciate your solid foundational understanding. Step 2: Know your weaknesses. Identify areas like exam-oriented preparation where improvement is needed, and clarify how to address them. Step 3: Balance your mindset. While it’s natural to feel sad about weaknesses, it’s equally important to appreciate your strengths. Many do not even start with a strong foundation. Step 4: Plan and execute aggressively. Create a concrete plan to address your weak areas and work diligently toward them. Within three months, you will begin to see tangible results, preparing you for the upcoming semester. For exam preparation, I suggested: – Mini college exams: Every three days, select random problems from textbooks (Real Analysis, Probability, Statistics) and solve them under a time limit (about one hour). This will train you to think under pressure. – Monthly semester-type exams: Compile questions from different books into a mock paper, set a date and time, and complete it as if it were a real exam. These frequent, self-created challenges provide immediate feedback, build confidence, and show progress far more quickly than waiting for official grades. Academic growth is like a flower blooming—it requires consistent nurturing and patience. By reaching out for guidance, understanding your strengths, and acknowledging your weaknesses, you are already 80% ahead. The remaining 20% comes down to planning, preparation, and focused practice, without allowing distractions or social media to derail you.

srijit-mukherjee,"No one has been able to give me a mathematical answer till now for the reason behind doing online augmentation compared to offline augmentation for easier data transformations. I decided to write one.. This article assumes you know deep learning and data augmentation . Introduction Data Augmentation is very important in Deep Learning for two reasons: increasing the variability of the dataset for better generalization Essentially if the training features X follow a distribution F, then data augmentation changes it to F’, where F’ is slightly perturbed from F. For example, In images, we can rotate, zoom in, and crop the images. They will make sure the model is invariant to rotation, zooming, and cropping. This makes the model generalizable to future unknown test cases. increasing the training data size for better optimization with a larger data size to avoid overfitting Essentially, we have a notion that the larger data size for training in deep learning is better for optimization, which can help us in avoiding overfitting. We add more training datasets to the model for learning. However, these two points are intricately related to each other. You can say the main goal is to increase the generalizability of the model. This is also a kind reminder that Data Augmentation is a kind of regularizer that makes sure that the model doesn’t learn the fact that a straight cat is a cat, but a rotated cat is not a cat. There have been many discussions that ask whether the model is learning when one sees multiple variations of the same dataset. The answer is that the main features remain the same in the data for example, in the original cat and rotated cat images (the eyes, the whiskers, etc). This is equivalent to the loss function where the output label of the rotated cat is the same as the output of the normal cat image. You can read some discussions here - Link 1 , Link 2 , Link 3 , and more. (Search data augmentation in pytorch and read mostly the Stack Exchange, Reddit, and pytorch community discussions.) Offline vs Online Augmentation Offline and online data augmentation refer to two distinct approaches to how data transformations are applied during the training process. Offline Data Augmentation : In offline data augmentation, transformations are applied to the entire dataset before training begins. This means that multiple variations of each original data sample are generated and stored in memory or on disk. During training, these augmented versions are then fed into the model as if they were distinct data samples. For example, if you have an original image of a cat, offline augmentation might create multiple rotated, flipped, and color-adjusted versions of that image beforehand. These augmented images are then used directly during the training process without further modification. Offline augmentation is computationally intensive during preprocessing, as it requires generating and storing all variations of the data in advance. However, once prepared, training can proceed more efficiently since the augmented data is readily available. Online Data Augmentation : Conversely, online data augmentation applies transformations to the data on-the-fly, during the training process. This means that each time a data sample is accessed during training, it is randomly transformed before being passed through the model. For instance, when an image of a cat is retrieved during training, online augmentation might randomly rotate it, flip it horizontally, or adjust its colors before feeding it into the model. These transformations are applied dynamically, ensuring that the model encounters different variations of each data sample across different epochs or batches. Online augmentation is more computationally efficient during preprocessing, as it doesn't require storing multiple copies of the data. However, it introduces a slight overhead during training because transformations must be applied in real time before each data sample is processed. In summary, while offline augmentation preprocesses and stores augmented data before training begins, online augmentation applies transformations dynamically during the training process. Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of computational efficiency and flexibility in handling data variations during model training. Why are they the same, and how to make it work? I had this question for a long time, but nobody explained me properly, and were handwaving in their approaches. Even though I searched the top articles on Google Search, but still had no understanding. I would suggest you read this list properly. The main questions are that In online augmentation, the dataset size is not increasing, then how is the model learning from more datasets? Also, in online augmentation, the dataset is transformed in every epoch, how is the model learning from the data? How is offline augmentation theoretically similar to online augmentation? Now I will explain briefly, why are they the same in an expected stochastic manner. They are not the same if the experimental setup is the same. A small change has to be made. But, before I continue I should remind you of how the optimization is done in Deep Learning. Deep Learning Process of Optimization Let’s say you have the following parameters: Training Data: T = 2^10 = 1024 Model M Batch Size: B = 2^5 = 32 Number of Epochs: E = 2^8 = 256 Optimization Style: Mini Batch Mode Optimizer: Optim Steps in Mini-Batch Optimization : Initialization : Initialize the model parameters randomly or using pre-trained weights. Epoch Iteration : Iterate through the entire training dataset for a fixed number of epochs (E = 256 in this case). Mini-Batch Iteration : For each epoch, partition the training data into mini-batches of size B = 32. Forward Pass : For each mini-batch, compute the forward pass through the network: Compute Loss : Calculate the loss function that measures the difference between the predicted outputs and the actual targets (labels). Backward Pass (Gradient Calculation) : Gradient Update (Parameter Update) : Epoch Completion : After all mini-batches are processed within an epoch, repeat the process for the next epoch (a total of E = 256 epochs in this case). Now including all the steps, we have in total (T/B * E = 1024/32 * 256 = 2^13 = 8192) steps where gradients are updated. Now, you want to increase the size of the training dataset by offline augmentation by k = 4 = 2^2 times. Training Data: kT = 2^2 * 2^10 = 2^12 = 4096 Model M Batch Size: B = 2^5 = 32 Number of Epochs: E = 2^8 = 256 Optimization Style: Mini Batch Mode Optimizer: Optim You will need therefore (kT/B * E = 4096/32 * 256 = 2^15 = 32768) steps with offline data augmentation with memory storage. How to do the same thing with online data augmentation. In online data augmentation, the training set with the size T changes on the fly, keeping the distribution the same. This is the good part, but to achieve the same result, we need to make an important change to the model. We need to change the number of epochs and multiply it by k times to keep the same number of gradient updates. Training Data: T = 2^10 = 1024 Model M Batch Size: B = 2^5 = 32 Number of Epochs: kE = 2^2 * 2^8 = 1024 Optimization Style: Mini Batch Mode Optimizer: Optim We will therefore get (T/B * kE = 1024/32 * 1024= 2^15 = 32768) gradient updates. Long story short: For getting the effect of k times increase of the training dataset in offline augmentation, you need to run k times epochs compared to the offline augmentation in the online augmentation to get the same result.",17.0,1.0,290,,20459,article,0,0,0,[],0,[],0,0,[],0,[],7594,7507,1263,1223,59,4,0,0,"no one has been able to give me a mathematical answer till now for the reason behind doing online augmentation compared to offline augmentation for easier data transformations. i decided to write one.. this article assumes you know deep learning and data augmentation . introduction data augmentation is very important in deep learning for two reasons: increasing the variability of the dataset for better generalization essentially if the training features x follow a distribution f, then data augmentation changes it to f, where f is slightly perturbed from f. for example, in images, we can rotate, zoom in, and crop the images. they will make sure the model is invariant to rotation, zooming, and cropping. this makes the model generalizable to future unknown test cases. increasing the training data size for better optimization with a larger data size to avoid overfitting essentially, we have a notion that the larger data size for training in deep learning is better for optimization, which can help us in avoiding overfitting. we add more training datasets to the model for learning. however, these two points are intricately related to each other. you can say the main goal is to increase the generalizability of the model. this is also a kind reminder that data augmentation is a kind of regularizer that makes sure that the model doesnt learn the fact that a straight cat is a cat, but a rotated cat is not a cat. there have been many discussions that ask whether the model is learning when one sees multiple variations of the same dataset. the answer is that the main features remain the same in the data for example, in the original cat and rotated cat images the eyes, the whiskers, etc. this is equivalent to the loss function where the output label of the rotated cat is the same as the output of the normal cat image. you can read some discussions here - link 1 , link 2 , link 3 , and more. search data augmentation in pytorch and read mostly the stack exchange, reddit, and pytorch community discussions. offline vs online augmentation offline and online data augmentation refer to two distinct approaches to how data transformations are applied during the training process. offline data augmentation : in offline data augmentation, transformations are applied to the entire dataset before training begins. this means that multiple variations of each original data sample are generated and stored in memory or on disk. during training, these augmented versions are then fed into the model as if they were distinct data samples. for example, if you have an original image of a cat, offline augmentation might create multiple rotated, flipped, and color-adjusted versions of that image beforehand. these augmented images are then used directly during the training process without further modification. offline augmentation is computationally intensive during preprocessing, as it requires generating and storing all variations of the data in advance. however, once prepared, training can proceed more efficiently since the augmented data is readily available. online data augmentation : conversely, online data augmentation applies transformations to the data on-the-fly, during the training process. this means that each time a data sample is accessed during training, it is randomly transformed before being passed through the model. for instance, when an image of a cat is retrieved during training, online augmentation might randomly rotate it, flip it horizontally, or adjust its colors before feeding it into the model. these transformations are applied dynamically, ensuring that the model encounters different variations of each data sample across different epochs or batches. online augmentation is more computationally efficient during preprocessing, as it doesn't require storing multiple copies of the data. however, it introduces a slight overhead during training because transformations must be applied in real time before each data sample is processed. in summary, while offline augmentation preprocesses and stores augmented data before training begins, online augmentation applies transformations dynamically during the training process. each approach has its trade-offs in terms of computational efficiency and flexibility in handling data variations during model training. why are they the same, and how to make it work?

At the same time, we brought out massive changes to our operating model by adopting Agile at scale and modernizing our overall DevSecOps. On a personal note, I started 2021 by moving to Vietnam with a crazy dream to ""build"" a RocketShip but what I did not realize was that I was hopping onto one - Techcombank! Wait! Aren't banks supposed to be dinosaurs and steam-liners? 2021 taught me what makes a large bank a rocketship: Aligned & Ambitious Shared Values! The greater and nobler the goal, the better the alignment! While we are aspiring to be a top 10 bank in ASEAN by profitability in the next couple of years, what is aligning our collective actions is the vision we defined together at the start of the year: ""Change Banking, Change Lives"". It is incredible when casual conversations on pollution can turn into us stopping coal financing (without any external market pressures, yet!). Agile Operating Model and People! Industrial era organization structures do not enable digital success. Technology and business are inseparable and need to be aligned under common business goals under one structure. There is no room for small experiments. At TCB, with centralized tribes under our Digital Office, we've been able to do this at scale. In a short time, we've built a strong cohort of tech-savvy business folks, probably the biggest design shop in Vietnam as well as created a strong engineering core and culture. Finally, what really sparks the engines (and makes it fun!), is the explosive composition of driven Vietnamese talent combined with top global experts. Tonnes of Fuel under a strong thrust vectoring system There is no room for small measures left if you want to digitally transform a large organization. The difference between the players who get it and those who don't will be very stark in the next 5 years. Issues on legacy infrastructure/ technology as well as business model need to be addressed head on. This requires accelerated investments. You need to manage the value realization in a very focussed manner (centrally - don't let provincial silo budget mentality constrain you). Period. With the accelerated spend, comes the responsibility to channel effort in a very focussed manner. Whether doubling up investments or hitting the kill switch, the leadership has made decisions in hours! And yes, this is a large bank I am talking about. As I reflect back on 2021, I feel a bit dizzy about what we have achieved on this Rocketship and cant stop feeling thankful to fellow colleagues that made it possible, despite whatever the year threw at us. A Heartfelt Thanks! To the next frontier... The JWST will take another six months before it reaches orbit and starts sending us images to enhance human knowledge and spark curiosity. Similarly, the journey has just begun for us. While we have built strong foundations on our core strategic pillars of digital, data and talent in 2021. 2022 will be the year we focus a lot more on connecting them together to create further customer magic and competitive moats.

ariadi,"Great conversations, tough questions, and one clear takeaway from TM Forum Tour: Tokyo. AI ambition is everywhere. Real AI impact is still rare. Thank you to TM Forum and fellow industry leaders for the engaging discussions on AI readiness and Autonomous Networks. In my session, “From AI readiness to real impact: Navigating the journey in 2026 and beyond,” we unpacked why organizations remain stuck in pilots and what truly separates the few that turn AI into measurable business outcomes. I also really enjoyed the fireside chat with TM Forum CTO George Glass . The candid discussion reinforced a reality many organizations quietly struggle with: moving toward autonomous networks is not a technology problem alone, but it’s a leadership, operating model, and execution challenge. The message from the day was clear: AI success is not about more pilots, more tools, or more hype. It’s about clear value-driven use cases, strong data foundations, architectural readiness, and the courage to change how we operate. Appreciate the thoughtful questions and follow-up discussions, especially around how telcos can progress toward autonomy realistically, without overestimating their current maturity.

sylwia-w-kulesza,"Is the juice worth the squeeze? Women in leadership carry a lot that rarely makes it into the job description. The pressure to perform without being labeled “too much.” The expectation to lead with empathy, but make tough calls without apology. The constant balancing act between ambition, responsibility, visibility, and self-doubt. Many of the women I work with are outwardly successful - but inwardly exhausted. They’re asking themselves a quiet question they rarely say out loud: “Is the juice worth the squeeze”? If you’ve ever felt stuck in survival mode, questioning whether the cost of pushing harder is still worth it, you’re not alone. Coaching isn’t about fixing you.

Qwen3.5 uses a 3:1 ratio of linear (Gated DeltaNet) to full attention layers. Kimi K2.5 picked the same ratio but with MLA. MiniMax went fully linear. GLM-5 added token-level sparsity. Nobody agrees on the best recipe. → Qwen3.5 is not best-in-class at anything, but is the most well-rounded open model. It trails GPT-5.2 on math and Claude on coding/agents, but dominates instruction following (IFBench 76.5) and vision (85.0 MMMU, 88.6 MathVision). → Once again, we see that agentic benchmarks are not the most reliable. Qwen3.5 reports two BrowseComp scores (69.0 vs 78.6) depending on the scaffolding strategy alone. This ~14% swing comes from context management, not model capability. → Native multimodality is now (almost) table stakes. Qwen3.5 fuses vision and text from pretraining, killing the separate ""VL"" model line. MMMU jumps from 80.6 (Qwen3-VL) to 85.0. → Models keep getting sparser: Qwen3.5 activates 4.3% of its parameters (17B/397B), down from Qwen3's 9.4%. MiniMax matches that ratio. Kimi pushes to 3.2%. Total parameter count is becoming a vanity metric. Following my previous articles on GLM-5 and MiniMax M2.5, I wrote one about Qwen3.5 with a lot of additional details (link in the comments!).

pranav-seth-49975a,"The gloomy headlines. The Deaths. The haltering economies. The job losses. The endless suffering. Despite the current gloom, we will recover. The shape of the recovery - V, U, W is debatable and largely beyond human hands - at the mercy of the way the virus behaves as well as the speed at which the vaccine is developed. The fluctuations along the path will dependent on the complex interaction of the virus path and the social, political and individual response. ""Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation."" Anthony Kedis, Red Hot Chili Peppers But what the new normal looks post recovery is definitely something what we can influence and plan for. And not just plan for, but actively work towards. A better world! “The best way to predict the future is to to create it.” Peter Drucker (arguably) My top three hopes for the new normal revolve around Food, the Environment and the new workforce. Sustainable & Safe Food: I hope this is the end of Wildlife trade and Bush meat, the end of Industrial Meat production, the death of mindless over-fishing, a stop to the culling of sharks for shark fin and outlawing of wildlife based medicine. I hope there is a lesson learnt by the people driving the demand. I hope the authorities clamp down with a force as brutal that is being used to stop the spread of the virus. I also hope that this drives further the plant based food moment and helps address the environmental and ethical ills of industrialised meat production. I wish for all food in the markets and all restaurants to have a food sustainability rating just like electronic equipment. And what choices will you make? How will you influence your governments on these topics? What F&B arrangement will you chose for your next office event? Will you still merrily eat at restaurants serving shark fin soup or Exotic meat? A healthier Environment: Even my 10 year old son gets it that the virus has been good for the Earth, while being catastrophic to Humans. The sea has never looked clearer in the Singapore Straits for decades. And the night skies are faintly visible even from the light polluted skies of Singapore. Endless memes aside, the negative impact of human activity has never been so starkly visible. I hope this leaves an indelible mark on all of us and the future decision makers. She can take it back. She will take it back someday. Dave Gilmour, Pink Floyd While I think the need to switch back the economic engines post pandemic will likely over-come any environmental concerns at the policy and governmental level. The need for growth in our capital systems as well as the near term thinking of our political and religious leaders will pull towards bringing the world to the old equilibrium. But I hope that you and me can take our environmental responsibilities a lot more seriously (including your author who is mentally struggling with his car choice). An audit of your lifestyles around the basic principles of refuse, reuse and recycle would be a good start. For most of us city dwellers, the amount of wastage in our daily lives has been unsustainable for a long time. It is time that we reverse this trend and hold each other and businesses we deal with accountable on this measure. Again to counter the worldwide governmental inaction towards enforcing environmental laws, we need to seek for more transparency on the environmental track record of products and services we consume. Similar to food, we need to push for clear environment ratings Labour, the Workforce and the WorkPlace: A Bloomberg article described the post pandemic Wuhan as a dystopia. I don't understand why - other than the general western press diarrhoea every time someone else is handling matters better than the west. To me it seems that even for human intensive manual jobs, they are able to push for productivity while reducing crowding. The fear and some hardships among the people are obvious and hopefully abate soon. But the factories are operating in less crowded locations. I hope the same applies as businesses come back online from Bangladesh to Vietnam. For most of us knowledge and service economy workers, it is clear in the post-Pandemic era that the physical co-location was a wasteful luxury. Once you get over the shock, most of the service work can merrily continue remotely. Offices should be only for meetings that require extensive negotiations and joint brain storming and for coming together for social purposes. The wasteful travel leading to over-crowding of the public transports and the road infrastructure needs to be eliminated. Weekly business travel across cities, day trips between cities - I hope they become rarities! Let travel be for leisure only! Moving to this work model will also spell the death knell of antiquated management models requiring ""face"" and ""putting in time"". Performance management could possibly get more robust with the focus on outcomes. The measures I speak above are just some top-of-mind thoughts for me. Each topic has deep implications and plenty of research exists around them. However, the intent of this article is only to leave you with one thought - please do not go back to business as usual.

Until an AI started doing them for me, with my voice input.👀 Half my time used to disappear into typing replies, switching tabs, and staring at blank documents. Not because the work was hard, but because everything required too many steps! This week, I started using Lemon: an AI assistant that feels less like a chatbot and more like someone actually executing tasks alongside you. And honestly..... it changed how my workflow feels. Here’s what stood out👇 Voice → Action, not just voice → text Press a key, speak your intent, and Lemon drafts emails, messages, or updates instantly. No blank cursor. No overthinking. From blank page → structured draft in seconds Need a document? Lemon can open a new Google Doc, research a topic, and generate a polished starting point with real structure and context. - Search without the tab chaos Instead of juggling multiple searches and windows, you can just ask for what you need — like finding a specific theater or info — and get a clean, direct result. And what surprised me most: It works like a second brain. After long research sessions, you can ask: “What should I change based on everything we found?” Lemon analyzes context and suggests strategic next steps: almost like having an on-demand operator. Editing and formatting without friction: Turn rough notes into polished reports just by speaking. Structure, tone, and formatting happen automatically! It honestly feels a bit like Tony Stark talking to Jarvis, thinking out loud while work actually moves forward😂 If you’re curious to try Lemon yourself: Comment “Lemon” and I’ll send you 30-day FREE access in your DMs!
