# LinkedIn Post Engagement Prediction — 3-Class Classification Plan

## 🎯 Objective

Predict how well a LinkedIn post will perform based on its features.

### Target:
**3-Class Engagement Classification**

- **Class 0 — Below Average**
- **Class 1 — Average**
- **Class 2 — Above Average**

Prediction based on post structure, content features, and author context.

---

# 1. Define Target Variable (Most Critical Step)

## Recommended Engagement Metric

### Option A — Raw Score
engagement_score = reactions + 2 × comments


### Option B — Normalized Score (Recommended)
engagement_rate = (reactions + 2 × comments) / followers


This removes bias from follower size.

---

## Create 3 Classes

### Global Threshold (Simple)
q1 = engagement_rate.quantile(0.33)
q2 = engagement_rate.quantile(0.66)


- Below q1 → Class 0
- q1–q2 → Class 1
- Above q2 → Class 2

---

### Per-Influencer Threshold (Recommended)

Each creator has different audience size.

group by influencer → compute quantiles


Benefits:
- Removes follower bias
- More realistic performance measure
- Better generalization

---

# 2. Feature Selection (Critical — Avoid Overfitting)

You currently have 200+ features → reduce to 30–60 features.

---

## Remove Data Leakage Features (Must Remove)

Anything using reactions/comments directly:

- reactions_per_word
- comments_per_word
- comment_to_reaction_ratio
- reactions_vs_influencer_avg
- comments_vs_influencer_avg
- influencer_total_engagement
- influencer_avg_reactions
- influencer_avg_comments
- influencer_avg_engagement

These leak target information.

---

## Remove Redundant Features

Keep only one version:

- char_count_original vs char_count_clean → keep clean
- word_count_original vs word_count_clean → keep clean
- style_emoji_count vs emoji_count → keep one

---

## Remove Non-Usable List Features

- urls_list
- mentions_list
- emojis_list
- hashtags_list

---

## Recommended High-Value Feature Groups

### Post Structure
- word_count_clean
- sentence_count
- line_break_count
- length_category

### Hook / Writing Quality
- hook_score
- hook_type
- power_pattern_score

### Media Features
- has_video
- has_carousel
- has_image

### Style Signals
- emoji_count
- question_mark_count
- exclamation_mark_count
- style_has_question
- style_has_numbers

### Content Signals
- sentiment_compound
- readability_flesch_ease
- text_lexical_diversity

### Topic Features
- topic_*

### Author Context
- followers
- influencer_consistency_reactions

---

# 3. Train / Test Split Strategy

## Basic
train_test_split(stratify=y)


## Recommended
GroupKFold by influencer name


Prevents memorizing influencer behavior.

---

# 4. Baseline Model

Start simple.

## Logistic Regression
- Fast
- Interpretable
- Validates pipeline

If baseline works → pipeline is correct.

---

# 5. Production Model (Recommended)

## Gradient Boosting Models

Best choices:

- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- CatBoost (easiest)

### Why:
- Handles nonlinear relationships
- Works well on tabular data
- Handles mixed feature types
- Strong performance

---

# 6. Feature Importance + Reduction

After training:

- Check feature importance
- Remove weak predictors
- Reduce to ~20–30 strong features

Benefits:
- Faster training
- Better generalization
- More interpretable model

---

# 7. Handle Class Imbalance

Check distribution:

y.value_counts()


If imbalanced:

- Use class weights
- Apply SMOTE oversampling

---

# 8. Evaluation Metrics

Do not rely on accuracy alone.

Use:

- F1 Score (macro)
- Confusion matrix
- ROC-AUC per class

Goal: good separation of high-performing posts.

---

# 9. Model Interpretation (High Business Value)

Use:

- SHAP values
- Feature importance analysis

This reveals:

- Optimal post length
- Effect of hooks
- Media impact
- Sentiment influence
- Content patterns driving engagement

# Advanced Improvements (Future Enhancements)

## 1. Regression Instead of Classification (Recommended)

Predict engagement rate directly:

predict engagement_rate → convert to class


Usually more accurate.

---

## 2. Per-Influencer Modeling

- Add influencer embeddings
- Cluster influencers and train separate models

---

## 3. Text Embeddings (Large Performance Boost)

Replace manual text features with embeddings:

content → sentence embedding


Combine with engineered features.

Benefits:
- Captures semantic meaning
- Better prediction performance

---

# Practical Execution Order

1. Define engagement_rate target
2. Remove leakage features
3. Reduce features to ~50
4. Train logistic regression baseline
5. Train gradient boosting model
6. Evaluate and reduce features
7. Add text embeddings (optional)
8. Deploy predictor

# Expected Insights From Model

Typical patterns observed:

- Medium-length posts perform best
- Strong hooks increase engagement
- Video increases reach
- Questions increase comments
- Personal stories perform well
- Certain sentiment patterns boost visibility

---

# End Goal

A system that predicts:

- Expected engagement class
- Key drivers of performance
- Actionable content optimization insights
