Create a python code which allows user to provide a paragraph about themselves and submit. Post submission, find all proper nouns, ner using a NLP pretrained model. Then iterate over all the entries and pass to google trends fro a week like this https://trends.google.com/explore?q=java&date=today%201-m&geo=SG, and find out any top queries and raising query. collect top 3 per topic . 
for example if you search for design patterns https://trends.google.com/explore?q=design%2520patterns&date=today%201-m&geo=SG we find agentic design patterns have 140% in top quries  and rasing query.
One edge case you should handle is like design pattern vs design patterns , design pattern is not trending while design patterns is trending. So like this ensure to use NLP properly and use user input as it is with out stemming to avoid any wrong trend finding
